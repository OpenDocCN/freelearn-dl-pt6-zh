- en: The continued growth in data, coupled with the need to make increasingly complex
    decisions against that data, is creating massive hurdles that prevent organizations
    from deriving insights in a timely manner using traditional analytical approaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find meaningful values and insights, deep learning evolved, which is a branch
    of machine learning algorithms based on learning multiple levels of abstraction.
    Neural networks, being at the core of deep learning, are used in predictive analytics,
    computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and performing
    a myriad of other complex tasks.

- en: Until date, most DL books available are written in Python. However, this book
    is conceived for developers, data scientists, machine learning practitioners,
    and deep learning enthusiasts who want to build powerful, robust, and accurate
    predictive models with the power of Deeplearning4j (a JVM-based DL framework),
    combining other open source Java APIs.

    AI systems using feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent
    neural networks, autoencoders, and factorization machines. Additionally, you will
    learn how to attain your deep learning programming on GPU in a distributed way.

- en: After finishing the book, you will be familiar with machine learning techniques,
    in particular, the use of Java for deep learning, and will be ready to apply your
    knowledge in research or commercial projects. In summary, this book is not meant
    to be read cover to cover. You can jump to a chapter that looks like something
    you are trying to accomplish or one that simply ignites your interest.

- en: Developers, data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and deep learning
    enthusiasts who wish to learn how to develop real-life deep learning projects
    by harnessing the power of JVM-based Deeplearning4j (DL4J), Spark, RankSys, and
    other open source libraries will find this book extremely useful. A sound understanding
    of Java is needed. Nevertheless, some basic prior experience of Spark, DL4J, and
    Maven-based project management will be useful to pick up the concepts quicker.

    Deep Learning*, explains some basic concepts of machine learning and artificial
    neural networks as the core of deep learning. It then briefly discusses existing
    and emerging neural network architectures. Next, it covers various features of
    deep learning frameworks and libraries. Then it shows how to solve Titanic survival
    prediction using a Spark-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Finally, it discusses
    some frequent questions related to this projects and general DL area.'

    Using Recurrent Type Networks*, demonstrates how to develop a DL application for
    cancer type classification from a very-high-dimensional gene expression dataset.
    First, it performs necessary feature engineering such that the dataset can feed
    into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Finally, it discusses some frequent
    questions related to this project and DL4J hyperparameters/nets tuning.'

    Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks*, demonstrates how to develop
    an end-to-end project for handling the multi-label image classification problem
    using CNN on top of the DL4J framework on real Yelp image datasets. It discusses

    Using Word2Vec and the LSTM Network*, shows how to develop a hands-on deep learning
    project that classifies review texts as either positive or negative sentiments.
    A large-scale movie review dataset will be used to train the LSTM model, and Word2Vec
    will be used as the neural embedding. Finally, it shows sample predictions for
    other review datasets.'
