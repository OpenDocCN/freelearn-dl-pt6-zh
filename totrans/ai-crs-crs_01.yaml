    the great tech entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, are even more true for people working
    in the **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) ecosystem. There is a reason why AI
    jobs are considered the sexiest jobs of the 21st century: besides being very well
    paid, AI is a fantastic topic to work on.'

    find applications of it in almost all industries. This is not a temporary trend;
    AI is here to stay. As the top AI leader and influencer Andrew Ng said, AI is
    the new electricity. Just like the industrial revolution transformed lives and
    jobs in the 19th century, AI is about to do the same in this 21st century. Hence,
    the more you understand and know how to use it, the more opportunities will open
    up to you.

    which is more than the current output of China and India combined. So, you've
    definitely made a great choice to study this field. Welcome to the incredible
    world of Artificial Intelligence!

    to understand them, and then, for those interested in the mathematics and pure
    theory behind the application, I will provide those as an option. The reason why
    I choose to focus on intuition rather than math is not only because I want to
    make this book easy to understand for everyone, but also because, in order to
    perform well in AI today, it is extremely important to have the right intuition.
    When you're solving a problem with AI, you have to figure out which model best
    fits your problem environment, and you can only do that when you have the proper
    intuition of how each AI model works.

    extroverts, will prefer the classroom, while others, introverts, will learn better
