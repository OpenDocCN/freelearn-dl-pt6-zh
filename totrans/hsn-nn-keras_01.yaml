- en: This section familiarizes the reader with the basics of operating neural networks,
    how to select appropriate data, normalize features, and execute a data processing
    pipeline from scratch. Readers will learn how to pair ideal hyperparameters with
    appropriate activation, loss functions, and optimizers. Once completed, readers
    will have experienced working with real-world data to architect and test deep
    learning models on the most prominent frameworks.
