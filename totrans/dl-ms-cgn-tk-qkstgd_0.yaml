- en: '**Artificial intelligence** (**AI**) is here to enhance humans by automating
    some of the tasks we do every day, so we can spend more time fully realizing our
    potential. We''ve been using software programs as tools to automate many of the
    simpler tasks. Now it is time to take on the challenge of automating more complicated
    tasks.'

- en: There's a lot happening in the area of AI and more people than ever are looking
    to expand their existing toolkit with new techniques to make their software smarter.
    Machine learning, and especially deep learning, are highly important tools with
    which we can enhance what we are already doing with our computers.

- en: This book aims to help you get to grips with one of the most popular deep learning
    tools, CNTK. We will look at what this relatively young open source deep learning
    framework offers. At the end of this book, you'll have a solid understanding of
    the framework and some of the scenarios in which it can be used.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is great for developers with some experience in Java, C#, or Python.
    We're assuming you're pretty new to machine learning. However, this book is also
    great for people who have worked with other deep learning frameworks before and
    want to learn another great deep learning tool.

- en: '[Chapter 1](9a2c8c46-f9a0-4e05-86ef-31300a28a7ba.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    CNTK*, introduces you to the CNTK framework and the world of deep learning. It
    explains how to install the tools on your computer and how to use a GPU with CNTK.'

    with CNTK*, explains how to build your first neural network with CNTK. We dive
    into the basic building blocks and see how to train a neural network with CNTK.'

    Your Neural Network*, shows you different methods of loading data for training
    neural networks. You''ll learn how to work with both small datasets, and datasets
    that don''t fit in your computer''s memory.'

    Performance*, teaches you how to work with metrics to validate the performance
    of your neural network. You''ll learn how to validate regression models and classification
    models and what to look for when trying to debug your neural network.'

    explains how to use convolutional neural networks to classify images. We''ll show
    you the building blocks needed to work with spatially-ordered data. We''ll also
    show you some of the most well-known neural network architectures for working
    with images.'

    Series Data*, teaches you how to use recurrent neural networks to build models
    that can reason over time. We''ll explain the various building blocks that you
    need to build and validate a recurrent neural network yourself, based on a IoT
    sample.'

    to Production*, shows you what it takes to deploy deep learning models to production.
    We''ll take a look at a DevOps environment with a **continuous integration/continuous
    deployment** (**CI**/**CD**) pipeline to teach you what it takes to train and
    deploy models in an agile engineering environment. We''ll show you how you can
    use a tool such as Azure Machine Learning service to take your machine learning
    efforts to the next level.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We recommend you have experience with Python 3 so that you know what the syntax
    looks like. You will need to run either Linux or Windows on a machine with a decent
    amount of memory and CPU power, as the samples in this book can take a long time
    to run on an older machine. If you are lucky enough to have a gaming graphics
    card in your machine from NVIDIA, we definitely recommend looking at the instructions
    on how to install the GPU version of CNTK, as this can speed up the samples by
    quite a large factor. Some sections in the book assume that you know a little
    bit about Java or C#. Although not required, it is useful to have a basic understanding
    of the syntax of one or more of these languages.
