- en: Neural networks are one of the most fascinating machine learning models for
    solving complex computational problems efficiently. Neural networks are used to
    solve a wide range of problems in different areas of AI and machine learning.

- en: This book explains the niche aspects of neural networking and provides you with
    the foundation to get started with advanced topics. The book begins with neural
    network design using the `neuralnet` package; then you'll build solid knowledge
    of how a neural network learns from data and the principles behind it. This book
    covers various types of neural networks, including recurrent neural networks and
    convoluted neural networks. You will not only learn how to train neural networks
    but also explore generalization of these networks. Later, we will delve into combining
    different neural network models and work with the real-world use cases.

    your applications with the help of the practical examples in the book.

    Network and Artificial Intelligence Concepts*, introduces the basic theoretical
    concepts of **Artificial Neural Networks** (**ANN**) and **Artificial Intelligence**
    (**AI**). It presents the simple applications of ANN and AI with usage of math
    concepts. Some introduction to R ANN functions is also covered.'

    Processes in Neural Networks*, shows how to do exact inferences in graphical models
    and show applications as expert systems. Inference algorithms are the base components
    for learning and using these types of models. The reader must at least understand
    their use and a bit about how they work.'

    network usage in deep learning. It goes through the details of the implementation
    using R packages. It covers the many hidden layers set up for deep learning and
    uses practical datasets to help understand the implementation.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is focused on neural networks in an R environment. We have used R
    version 3.4.1 to build various applications and the open source and enterprise-ready
    professional software for R, RStudio version 1.0.153\. We focus on how to utilize
    various R libraries in the best possible way to build real-world applications.
    In that spirit, we have tried to keep all the code as friendly and readable as
    possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code
    and readily use it in different scenarios.
