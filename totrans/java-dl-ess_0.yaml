- en: With an increasing interest in AI around the world, deep learning has attracted
    a great deal of public attention. Every day, deep learning algorithms are used
    across different industries. Deep learning has provided a revolutionary step to
    actualize AI. While it is a revolutionary technique, deep learning is often thought
    to be complicated, and so it is often kept from much being known of its contents.
    Theories and concepts based on deep learning are not complex or difficult. In
    this book, we'll take a step-by-step approach to learn theories and equations
    for the correct understanding of deep learning. You will find implementations
    from scratch, with detailed explanations of the cautionary notes for practical
    use cases.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Java developers who want to know about deep learning algorithms
    and wish to implement them in applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since this book covers the core concepts of and approaches to both machine learning
    and deep learning, no previous experience in machine learning is required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, we will implement deep learning algorithms with very simple codes, so
    elementary Java developers will also find this book useful for developing both
    their Java skills and deep learning skills.
