<p class="mce-root">Deep learning has helped many industries/companies to solve big challenges, enhance their products, and strengthen their infrastructure. The advantage of deep learning is that you neither have to design decision-making algorithms nor make decisions regarding important dataset features. Your neural network is capable of doing both. We have seen enough theoretical books that leave the audience all at sea having explained complex concepts. It is also important to know how/when you can apply what you have learned, especially in relation to enterprise. This is a concern for advanced technologies such as deep learning. You may have undertaken capstone projects, but you also want to take your knowledge to the next level.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Of course, there are best practices in enterprise development that we may not cover in this book. We don't want readers to question themselves about the purpose of developing an application if it is too tedious to deploy in production. We want something very straightforward, targeting the largest developer community in the world. We have used <strong>DL4J</strong> (short for <strong>Deeplearning4j</strong>) throughout this book to demonstrate examples for the same reason. It has DataVec for <strong>ETL</strong> (short for <strong>Extract, Transform, and Load</strong>), ND4J as a scientific computation library, and a DL4J core library to develop and deploy neural network models in production. There are cases where DL4J outperforms some of the major deep learning libraries on the market. We are not degrading other libraries, as it all depends on what you want to do with them. You may also try accommodating multiple libraries in different phases if you don't want to bother switching to multiple technical stacks.</p>

<p>In order to get the most out of this book, we recommend that readers have basic knowledge of deep learning and data analytics. It is also preferable for readers to have basic knowledge of MLP (multilayer perceptrons) or feed forward networks, recurrent neural networks, LSTM, word vector representations, and some level of debugging skills to interpret the errors from the error stack. As this book targets Java and the DL4J library, readers should also have sound knowledge of Java and DL4J. This book is not suitable for anyone who is new to programming or who doesn't have basic knowledge of deep learning.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Create a <kbd>CSVRecordReader</kbd> to hold customer churn data."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>File file = new File("Churn_Modelling.csv");<br/>recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit(file)); </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>mvn clean instal</strong>l</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "We just need to click on the <span class="packt_screen">Model</span> tab on the left-hand sidebar.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
