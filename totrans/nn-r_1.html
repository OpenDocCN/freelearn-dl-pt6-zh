<p class="calibre2">From the scientific and philosophical studies conducted over the centuries, special mechanisms have been identified that are the basis of human intelligence. Taking inspiration from their operations, it was possible to create machines that imitate part of these mechanisms. The problem is that they have not yet succeeded in imitating and integrating all of them, so the <strong class="calibre1">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">AI</strong>) systems we have are largely incomplete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A decisive step in the improvement of such machines came from the use of so-called <strong class="calibre1">Artificial Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">ANNs</strong>) that, starting from the mechanisms regulating natural neural networks, plan to simulate human thinking. S<span>oftware can now imitate the mechanisms needed to win a chess match or to translate text into a different language in accordance with its grammatical rules.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2">This chapter introduces the basic theoretical concepts of ANN and AI. Fundamental understanding of the following is expected:</p>

<li class="calibre17">Basic high school mathematics; differential calculus and functions such as <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em></li>
<li class="calibre17">R programming and usage of R libraries</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">We will go through the basics of neural networks and try out one model using R. This chapter is a foundation for neural networks and all the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">ANN concepts</li>

<p class="calibre2">The brain is the most important organ of the human body. It is the central processing unit for all the functions performed by us. Weighing only 1.5 kilos, it has around 86 billion neurons. A neuron is defined as a cell transmitting nerve impulses or electrochemical signals. The brain is a complex network of neurons which process information through a system of several interconnected neurons. It has always been challenging to understand the brain functions; however, due to advancements in computing technologies, we can now program neural networks artificially.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The discipline of ANN arose from the thought of mimicking the functioning of the same human brain that was trying to solve the problem. The drawbacks of conventional approaches and their successive applications have been overcome within well-defined technical environments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">AI or machine intelligence is a field of study that aims to give cognitive powers to computers to program them to learn and solve problems. Its objective is to simulate computers with human intelligence. AI cannot imitate human intelligence completely; computers can only be programmed to do some aspects of the human brain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Machine learning is a branch of AI which helps computers to program themselves based on the input data. Machine learning gives AI the ability to do data-based problem solving. ANNs are an example of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre1">Deep learning</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">DL</strong>) is complex set of neural networks with more layers of processing, which develop high levels of abstraction. They are typically used for complex tasks, such as image recognition, image classification, and hand writing identification.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the audience think that neural networks are difficult to learn and use it as a black box. This book intends to open the black box and help one learn the internals with implementation in R. With the working knowledge, we can see many use cases where neural networks can be made tremendously useful seen in the following image:</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Neural networks are inspired by the way the human brain works. A human brain can process huge amounts of information using data sent by human senses (especially vision). The processing is done by neurons, which work on electrical signals passing through them and applying flip-flop logic, like opening and closing of the gates for signal to transmit through. The following images shows the structure of a neuron:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="alignnone" src="../images/00006.jpeg"/><br class="title-page-name"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The major components of each neuron are:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Dendrites</strong>: Entry points in each neuron which take input from other neurons in the network in form of electrical impulses</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Cell Body</strong>: It generates inferences from the dendrite inputs and decides what action to take</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Axon terminals</strong>: They transmit outputs in form of electrical impulses to next neuron</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Each neuron processes signals only if it exceeds a certain threshold. Neurons either fire or do not fire; it is either <em class="calibre14">0</em> or <em class="calibre14">1</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">AI has been a domain for sci-fi movies and fiction books. ANNs within AI have been around since the 1950s, but we have made them more dominant in the past 10 years due to advances in computing architecture and performance. There have been major advancements in computer processing, leading to:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">Massive parallelism</li>
<li class="calibre17">Distributed representation and computation</li>
<li class="calibre17">Learning and generalization ability</li>
<li class="calibre17">Fault tolerance</li>
<li class="calibre17">Low energy consumption</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">In the domain of numerical computations and symbol manipulation, solving problems on-top of centralized architecture, modern day computers have surpassed humans to a greater extent. Where they actually lag behind with such an organizing structure is in the domains of pattern recognition, noise reduction, and optimizing. A toddler can recognize his/her mom in a huge crowd, but a computer with a centralized architecture wouldn’t be able to do the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is where the biological neural network of the brain has been outperforming machines, and hence the inspiration to develop an alternative loosely held, decentralized architecture mimicking the brain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">ANNs are massively parallel computing systems consisting of an extremely large number of simple processors with many interconnections.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the leading global news agencies, Guardian, used big data in digitizing the archives by uploading the snapshots of all the archives they had had. However, for a user to copy the content and use it elsewhere is the limitation here. To overcome that, one can use an ANN for text pattern recognition to convert the images to text file and then to any format according to the needs of the end-users.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Similar to the biological neuron structure, ANNs define the neuron as a central processing unit, which performs a mathematical operation to generate one output from a set of inputs. The output of a neuron is a function of the weighted sum of the inputs plus the bias. Each neuron performs a very simple operation that involves activating if the total amount of signal received exceeds an activation threshold, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border1" src="../images/00007.gif"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The function of the entire neural network is simply the computation of the outputs of all the neurons, which is an entirely deterministic calculation. Essentially, ANN is a set of mathematical function approximations. We would now be introducing new terminology associated with ANNs:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">Input layer</li>
<li class="calibre17">Hidden layer</li>
<li class="calibre17">Output layer</li>
<li class="calibre17">Weights</li>
<li class="calibre17">Bias</li>
<li class="calibre17">Activation functions</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre2">Any neural network processing a framework has the following architecture:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border2" src="../images/00008.gif"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">There is a set of inputs, a processor, and a set of outputs. This layered approach is also followed in neural networks. The inputs form the <strong class="calibre1">input layer</strong>, the <strong class="calibre1">middle layer(s)</strong> which performs the processing is called the <strong class="calibre1">hidden layer(s)</strong>, and the <strong class="calibre1">output(s)</strong> forms the output layer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our neural network architectures are also based on the same principle. The hidden layer has the magic to convert the input to the desired output. The understanding of the hidden layer requires knowledge of weights, bias, and activation functions, which is our next topic of discussion.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Weights in an ANN are the most important factor in converting an input to impact the output. This is similar to slope in linear regression, where a weight is multiplied to the input to add up to form the output. Weights are numerical parameters which determine how strongly each of the neurons affects the other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a typical neuron, if the inputs are <em class="calibre14">x<sub class="calibre25">1</sub></em>, <em class="calibre14">x<sub class="calibre25">2</sub></em>, and <em class="calibre14">x<sub class="calibre25">3</sub></em>, then the <span>synaptic</span> weights to be applied to them are denoted as <em class="calibre14">w<sub class="calibre25">1</sub></em>, <em class="calibre14">w<sub class="calibre25">2</sub></em>, and <em class="calibre14">w<sub class="calibre25">3</sub></em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Output is</p>
<div class="calibre26"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre2">where <em class="calibre14">i</em> is <em class="calibre14">1</em> to the number of inputs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Simply, this is a matrix multiplication to arrive at the weighted sum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bias is like the intercept added in a linear equation. It is an additional parameter which is used to adjust the output along with the weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The processing done by a neuron is thus denoted as :</p>
<div class="calibre28"><img src="../images/00010.jpeg" class="calibre29"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre2">A function is applied on this output and is called an <strong class="calibre1">activation function</strong>. The input of the next layer is the output of the neurons in the previous layer, as shown in the following image:</p>

<p class="calibre2">One iteration or pass through the process of providing the network with an input and updating the network's weights is called an <strong class="calibre1">epoch</strong>. It is a full run of feed-forward and backpropagation for update of weights. It is also one full read through of the entire dataset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Typically, many epochs, in the order of tens of thousands at times, are required to train the neural network efficiently. We will see more about epochs in the forthcoming chapters.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The abstraction of the processing of neural networks is mainly achieved through the activation functions. An activation function is a mathematical function which converts the input to an output, and adds the magic of neural network processing. Without activation functions, the working of neural networks will be like linear functions. A linear function is one where the output is directly proportional to input, for example:</p>
<div class="calibre30"><img src="../images/00012.jpeg" class="calibre31"/></div>
<div class="calibre30"><img src="../images/00013.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre2">A linear function is a polynomial of one degree. Simply, it is a straight line without any curves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, most of the problems the neural networks try to solve are nonlinear and complex in nature. To achieve the nonlinearity, the activation functions are used. Nonlinear functions are high degree polynomial functions, for example:</p>
<div class="calibre30"><img src="../images/00014.jpeg" class="calibre33"/></div>
<div class="calibre30"><img src="../images/00015.jpeg" class="calibre34"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre2">The graph of a nonlinear function is curved and adds the complexity factor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Activation functions give the nonlinearity property to neural networks and make them true universal function approximators.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A unit step activation function is a much-used feature in neural networks. The output assumes value <em class="calibre14">0</em> for negative argument and <em class="calibre14">1</em> for positive argument. The function is as follows:</p>

<p class="calibre2">The range is between <em class="calibre14">(0,1)</em> and the output is binary in nature. These types of activation functions are useful for binary schemes.

<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> function is a mathematical function that produces a sigmoidal curve; a characteristic curve for its <em class="calibre14">S</em> shape.

<p class="calibre2">Another very popular and widely used activation feature is the <em class="calibre14">tanh</em> function. If you look at the figure that follows, you can notice that it looks very similar to <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em>; in fact, it is a scaled <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> function. This is a nonlinear function, defined in the range of values <em class="calibre14">(-1, 1)</em>, so you need not worry about activations blowing up. One thing to clarify is that the gradient is stronger for <em class="calibre14">tanh</em> than <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> (the derivatives are more steep). Deciding between <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> and <em class="calibre14">tanh</em> will depend on your gradient strength requirement. Like the <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em>, <em class="calibre14">tanh</em> also has the missing slope problem. The function is defined by the following formula:</p>

<p class="calibre2">Given that neural networks are to support nonlinearity and more complexity, the activation function to be used has to be robust enough to have the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">It should be differential; we will see why we need differentiation in backpropagation. It should not cause gradients to vanish.</li>
<li class="calibre17">It should be simple and fast in processing.</li>
<li class="calibre17">It should not be zero centered.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> is the most used activation function, but it suffers from the following setbacks:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">Since it uses logistic model, the computations are time consuming and complex</li>
<li class="calibre17">It cause gradients to vanish and no signals pass through the neurons at some point of time</li>
<li class="calibre17">It is slow in convergence</li>
<li class="calibre17"><span>It is</span> not zero centered</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">These drawbacks are solved by ReLU. ReLU is simple and is faster to process. It does not have the vanishing gradient problem and has shown vast improvements compared to the <em class="calibre14">sigmoid</em> and <em class="calibre14">tanh</em> functions. ReLU is the most preferred activation function for neural networks and DL problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">ReLU is used for hidden layers, while the output layer can use a <kbd class="calibre13">softmax</kbd> function for logistic problems and a linear function of regression problems.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A perceptron is a single neuron that classifies a set of inputs into one of two categories (usually <em class="calibre14">1</em> or <em class="calibre14">-1</em>). If the inputs are in the form of a grid, a perceptron can be used to recognize visual images of shapes. The perceptron usually uses a step function, which returns <em class="calibre14">1</em> if the weighted sum of the inputs exceeds a threshold, and <em class="calibre14">0</em> otherwise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When layers of perceptron are combined together, they form a multilayer architecture, and this gives the required complexity of the neural network processing. <strong class="calibre1">Multi-Layer Perceptrons</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">MLPs</strong>) are the most widely used architecture for neural networks.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The processing from input layer to hidden layer(s) and then to the output layer is called <strong class="calibre1">forward propagation</strong>. The <em class="calibre14">sum(input*weights)+bias</em> is applied at each layer and then the activation function value is propagated to the next layer. The next layer can be another hidden layer or the output layer. The construction of neural networks uses large number of hidden layers to give rise to <strong class="calibre1">Deep Neural Network</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">DNN</strong>).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the output is arrived at, at the last layer (the output layer), we compute the error (the predicted output minus the original output). This error is required to correct the weights and biases used in forward propagation. Here is where the derivative function is used. The amount of weight that has to be changed is determined by <strong class="calibre1">gradient descent</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The backpropagation process uses the partial derivative of each neuron's activation function to identify the slope (or gradient) in the direction of each of the incoming weights. The gradient suggests how steeply the error will be reduced or increased for a change in the weight. The backpropagation keeps changing the weights until there is greatest reduction in errors by an amount known as the <strong class="calibre1">learning rate</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Learning rate is a scalar parameter, analogous to step size in numerical integration, used to set the rate of adjustments to reduce the errors faster. Learning rate is used in backpropagation during adjustment of weights and bias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More the learning rate, the faster the algorithm will reduce the errors and faster will be the training process:</p>

<p class="calibre2">We shall take a step-by-step approach to understand the forward and reverse pass with a single hidden layer. The input layer has one neuron and the output will solve a binary classification problem (predict 0 or 1). In the following figure is shown a <span>forward and reverse pass with a single hidden layer:</span></p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border6" src="../images/00027.jpeg"/></div>

<li value="9" class="calibre17">Apply the weight adjustments.</li>

<p class="calibre2">The complete pass back and forth is called a <strong class="calibre1">training cycle</strong> or <strong class="calibre1">epoch</strong>. The updated weights and biases are used in the next cycle. We keep recursively training until the error is very minimal.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">The flow of the signals in neural networks can be either in only one direction or in recurrence. In the first case, we call the neural network architecture feed-forward, since the input signals are fed into the input layer, then, after being processed, they are forwarded to the next layer, just as shown in the following figure. MLPs and radial basis functions are also good examples of feed-forward networks. <span>In the following figure is shown an MLPs architecture:</span></p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border7" src="../images/00028.gif"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">When the neural network has some kind of internal recurrence, meaning that the signals are fed back <span>to</span> a neuron or layer that has already received and processed that signal, the network is of the type feedback, as shown in the following image:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border8" src="../images/00029.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="mce-root">The special reason to add recurrence in a network is the production of a dynamic behavior, particularly when the network addresses problems involving time series or pattern recognition, that require an internal memory to reinforce the learning process. However, such networks are particularly difficult to train, eventually failing to learn. Most of the feedback networks are single layer, such as the <strong class="calibre1">Elman</strong> and <strong class="calibre1">Hopfield</strong> networks, but it is possible to build a recurrent multilayer network, such as echo and recurrent MLP networks.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Gradient descent is an iterative approach for error correction in any learning model. For neural networks during backpropagation, the process of iterating the update of weights and biases with the error times derivative of the activation function is the gradient descent approach. The steepest descent step size is replaced by a similar size from the previous step. Gradient is basically defined as the slope of the curve and is the derivative of the activation function:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="image-border9" src="../images/00030.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The objective of deriving gradient descent at each step is to find the global cost minimum, where the error is the lowest. And this is where the model has a good fit for the data and predictions are more accurate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gradient descent can be performed either for the full batch or stochastic. In full batch gradient descent, the gradient is computed for the full training dataset, whereas <strong class="calibre1">Stochastic Gradient Descent</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">SGD</strong>) takes a single sample and performs gradient calculation. It can also take mini-batches and perform the calculations. One advantage of SGD is faster computation of gradients.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The basic foundation for ANNs is the same, but various neural network models have been designed during its evolution. The following are a few of the ANN models:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Adaptive Linear Element</strong> (<span><strong class="calibre1">ADALINE</strong>),</span> is a simple perceptron which can solve only linear problems. Each neuron takes the weighted linear sum of the inputs and passes it to a bi-polar function, which either produces a <em class="calibre14">+1</em> or <em class="calibre14">-1</em> depending on the sum. The function checks the sum of the inputs passed and if the net is <em class="calibre14">&gt;= 0</em>, it is <em class="calibre14">+1</em>, else it is <em class="calibre14">-1</em>.</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Multiple ADALINEs</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">MADALINE</strong>), is a multilayer network of ADALINE units.</li>
<li class="calibre17">Perceptrons are single layer neural networks (single neuron or unit), where the input is multidimensional (vector) and the output is a function on the weight sum of the inputs.</li>
<li class="calibre17">Radial basis function network is an ANN where a radial basis function is used as an activation function. The network output is a linear combination of radial basis functions of the inputs and some neuron parameters.</li>
<li class="calibre17">Feed-forward is the simplest form of neural networks. The data is processed across layers without any loops are cycles. We will study the following feed- forward networks in this book:
<ul class="calibre39">
<li class="calibre17">Autoencoder</li>
<li class="calibre17">Probabilistic</li>
<li class="calibre17">Time delay</li>
<li class="calibre17">Covolutional</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">RNNs</strong>), unlike feed-forward networks, <span>propagate data forward and also backwards from later processing stages to earlier stages. The following are the types of RNNs; we shall study them in our later chapters:</span>
<ul class="calibre39">
<li class="calibre17">Hopfield networks</li>
<li class="calibre17">Boltzmann machine</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Self Organizing Maps</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">SOMs</strong>)</li>
<li class="calibre17"><strong class="calibre1">Bidirectional Associative Memory</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">BAM</strong>)</li>

<p class="calibre2">To understand all the steps in the code just proposed, we will look at them in detail. Do not worry if a few steps seem unclear at this time, you will be able to look into it in the following examples. First, the code snippet will be shown, and the explanation will follow:</p>
<pre class="calibre24"><strong class="calibre1">library("neuralnet")</strong></pre>
<p class="calibre2">The line in R includes the library <kbd class="calibre13">neuralnet()</kbd> in our program. <kbd class="calibre13">neuralnet()</kbd> is part of <strong class="calibre1">Comprehensive R Archive Network</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">CRAN</strong>), which contains numerous R libraries for various applications.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This reads the CSV file with separator <kbd class="calibre13">,</kbd>(comma), and header is the first line in the file. <kbd class="calibre13">names()</kbd> would display the header of the file.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Training of neural networks using the backpropagation, resilient backpropagation with (Riedmiller, 1994) or without weight backtracking (Riedmiller, 1993), or the modified globally convergent version by Anastasiadis et al. (2005). The package allows flexible settings through custom-choice of error and activation function. Furthermore, the calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O &amp; Intrator N, 1993) is implemented.</p>

<p class="calibre2">To improve our practice with the <kbd class="calibre13">nnet</kbd> library, we look at another example. This time we will use the data collected at a restaurant through customer interviews. The customers were asked to give a score to the following aspects: service, ambience, and food. They were also asked whether they would leave the tip on the basis of these scores. In this case, the number of inputs is <kbd class="calibre13">2</kbd> and the output is a categorical value (<kbd class="calibre13">Tip=1</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre13">No-tip=0</kbd>).</p>

<p class="calibre2">Using <kbd class="calibre13">NeuralNetTools</kbd>, it's possible to obtain the relative importance of input variables in neural networks using <kbd class="calibre13">garson</kbd> algorithm:</p>
<pre class="calibre24"><strong class="calibre1">garson(model)</strong></pre>

<p class="calibre2">Let us take a look at some of the cons of neural networks:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks are black boxes, meaning we cannot know how much each independent variable is influencing the dependent variables.</li>
<li class="calibre17">It is computationally very expensive and time consuming to train with traditional CPUs.</li>
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks depend a lot on training data. This leads to the problem of over-fitting and generalization. The mode relies more on the training data and may be tuned to the data.</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre2">The increase in processing capabilities has been a tremendous booster for usage of neural networks in day-to-day problems. GPU is a specialized processor designed to perform graphical operations (for example, gaming, 3D animation, and so on). They perform mathematically intensive tasks and are additional to the CPU. The CPU performs the operational tasks of the computer, while the GPU is used to perform heavy workload processing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The neural network architecture needs heavy mathematical computational capabilities and GPU is the preferred candidate here. The vectorized dot matrix product between the weights and inputs at every neuron can be run in parallel through GPUs. The advancements in GPUs is popularizing neural networks. The applications of DL in image processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, and weather modeling are benefiting through GPUs.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we saw an overview of ANNs. Neural networks implementation is simple, but the internals are pretty complex. We can summarize neural network as a universal mathematical function approximation. Any set of inputs which produce outputs can be made a black box mathematical function through a neural network, and the applications are enormous in the recent years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We saw the following in this chapter:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre17">Neural network is a machine learning technique and is data-driven</li>
<li class="calibre17">AI, machine learning, and neural networks are different paradigms of making machines work like humans</li>
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks can be used for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning</li>
<li class="calibre17">Weights, biases, and activation functions are important concepts in neural networks</li>
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks are nonlinear and non-parametric</li>
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks are very fast in prediction and are most accurate in comparison with other machine learning models</li>
<li class="calibre17">There are input, hidden, and output layers in any neural network architecture</li>
<li class="calibre17">Neural networks are based on building MLP, and we understood the basis for neural networks: weights, bias, activation functions, feed-forward, and backpropagation processing</li>
<li class="calibre17">Forward and backpropagation are techniques to derive a neural network model</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Neural networks can be implemented through many programming languages, namely Python, R, MATLAB, C, and Java, among others. The focus of this book will be building applications using R. DNN and AI systems are evolving on the basis of neural networks. In the forthcoming chapter, we will drill through different types of neural networks and their various applications.</p>
