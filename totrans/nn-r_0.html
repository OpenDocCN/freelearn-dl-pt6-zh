<p class="calibre2">Neural networks are one of the most fascinating machine learning models for solving complex computational problems efficiently. Neural networks are used to solve a wide range of problems in different areas of AI and machine learning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This book explains the niche aspects of neural networking and provides you with the foundation to get started with advanced topics. The book begins with neural network design using the <kbd class="calibre13">neuralnet</kbd> package; then you'll build solid knowledge of how a neural network learns from data and the principles behind it. This book covers various types of neural networks, including recurrent neural networks and convoluted neural networks. You will not only learn how to train neural networks but also explore generalization of these networks. Later, we will delve into combining different neural network models and work with the real-world use cases.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the end of this book, you will learn to implement neural network models in your applications with the help of the practical examples in the book.</p>

This chapter covers an implementation of perceptrons using R.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0096.html#2RHM00-263fb608a19f4bb5955f37a7741ba5c4" class="calibre4"><span>Chapter 5</span></a>, <em class="calibre14"><span>Training and Visualizing a Neural Network in R</span></em>, covers another example of training a neural network with a dataset. It also gives a better understanding of neural networks with a graphical representation of input, hidden, and output layers using the <kbd class="calibre13">plot()</kbd> function in R.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0111.html#39REE0-263fb608a19f4bb5955f37a7741ba5c4" class="calibre4"><span>Chapter 6</span></a>, <em class="calibre14"><span>Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks</span></em>, introduces <strong class="calibre1">Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">RNN</strong>) and <strong class="calibre1">Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">CNN</strong>) with their implementation in R. Several examples are proposed to understand the basic concepts.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0123.html#3L9L60-263fb608a19f4bb5955f37a7741ba5c4" class="calibre4"><span>Chapter 7</span></a>, <em class="calibre14"><span>Use Cases of Neural Networks – Advanced Topics</span></em>, presents neural network applications from different fields and how neural networks can be used in the AI world. This will help the reader understand the practical usage of neural network algorithms. The reader can enhance his or her skills further by taking different datasets and running the R code.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This book is focused on neural networks in an R environment. We have used R version 3.4.1 to build various applications and the open source and enterprise-ready professional software for R, RStudio version 1.0.153. We focus on how to utilize various R libraries in the best possible way to build real-world applications. In that spirit, we have tried to keep all the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different scenarios.</p>
