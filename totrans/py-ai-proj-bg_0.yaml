- en: 'This book begins with building your first prediction model using the popular
    Python library, scikit-learn. You will understand how to build a classifier using
    effective machine learning techniques: random forest and decision trees. With
    exciting projects on predicting bird species, analyzing student performance data,
    song genre identification, and spam detection, you will learn the fundamentals
    and various algorithms and techniques that foster the development of such smart
    applications. You will also understand deep learning and the neural network mechanism
    through these projects with the use of the Keras library.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0019.html#I3QM0-75b4a1a12ebd45eaadfabacea6d96589), *Building
    Your Own Prediction Models*, introduces classification and techniques for evaluation,
    and then explains decision trees, followed by a coding project in which a predictor
    for student performance is built.'

    with Random Forests*, looks at random forests and uses them in a coding project
    for classifying bird species.'

    for Comment Classification*, introduces text processing and the bag-of-words technique.
    Then shows how this technique can be used to build a spam detector for YouTube
    comments. Next, you will learn about the sophisticated Word2Vec model and practice
    it with a coding project that detects positive and negative product, restaurant,
    and movie reviews.'

    Networks*, covers a brief introduction to neural networks, proceeds with feedforward
    neural networks, and looks at a program to identify the genre of a song with neural
    networks. Finally, you will revise the spam detector from earlier to make it work
    with neural networks.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](part0048.html#1DOR00-75b4a1a12ebd45eaadfabacea6d96589), *Deep Learning*, discusses
    deep learning and CNNs. You will practice convolutional neural networks and deep
    learning with two projects. First, you will build a system that can read handwritten
    mathematical symbols and then revisit the bird species identifier and change the
    implementation to use a deep convolutional neural network that is significantly
    more accurate.'
