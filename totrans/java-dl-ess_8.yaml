    a board game in which two players are trying to take over more territory than
    their opponent. The news of ''AI beating a human in Go'' shocked not only Go players
    but also the whole world, when a machine, that is, AI, beat a human at Go. DeepMind
    ([https://deepmind.com/](https://deepmind.com/)), which was bought by Google,
    has been developing the Go-playing AI, called AlphaGo, and AlphaGo has beaten
    world-class player Lee Sedol for a fourth time, to win the five-game series four
    games to one in Google''s DeepMind Challenge Match. Each game was delivered on
    livestream via YouTube, and many people watched the games in real time. You can

    were excited by AlphaGo; but why did this news got so much attention? For another
    board game example, in a chess match, Deep Blue, which was developed by IBM, beat
    the world chess champion in 1997\. Of course, it became big news at that time,
    as this was also a moment when a machine beat a human. Why then, when this was
    not the first time a machine had beaten a human, was news of AlphaGo''s triumph
    against Lee SeDol so world-shaking? What is the difference between Chess and Go?
    Well, the difference is in the complexity of the patterns of Go. In fact, Go has
    many more strategy patterns than Chess. In popular board games such as Chess,
    Shogi, and Go, the numbers of patterns to determine who wins or loses are as follows:'

    is and easily imagine that a machine also needs an enormous amount of calculation.
    Because of this huge number of patterns, until recently, people thought it was
    impossible for AlphaGo to beat a human, or that it would be 100 years or 200 years
    before AlphaGo would beat a human. It was considered impossible for a machine
    to calculate the patterns of Go within a realistic time. But now, in a matter
    of a few years, a machine has beaten a human. According to the Google research
    blog, 1.5 months before the DeepMind Challenge Match was held, DeepMind could
    predict the human's moves 57% of the time ([http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html](http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html)).
    The fact that a machine won against a human definitely had an impact, but the
    fact that a machine could learn the strategy of Go within a realistic time was
    even more surprising. DeepMind applies deep neural networks with the combination
    of Monte Carlo tree search and reinforcement learning, which shows the width of
    the application range for the algorithm of deep neural networks.

    had a boost. You might notice that you hear the words "deep learning" in the media
    more often recently. It can be said that the world's expectations of AI have been
    increased that much. What is interesting is that the term "deep learning," which
    was originally a technical term, is now used commonly in daily news. You can see
    that the image of the term **AI** has been changing. Probably, until just a few
    years ago, if people heard about AI, many of them would have imagined an actual
    robot, but how about now? 'The term AI is now often used—not particularly consciously—with
    regard to software or applications, and is accepted as commonplace. This is nothing
    but an indication that the world has started to understand AI, which has been
    developed for research, correctly. If a technology is taken in the wrong direction,
    it generates repulsion, or some people start to develop the technology incorrectly;
    however, it seems that this boom in AI technology is going in a good direction
    so far.

    people feel certain fears or anxieties. It's easy to imagine that some people
    might think the world where machines dominate humans, like in sci-fi movies or
    novels, is coming sooner or later, especially after AlphaGo won over Lee SeDol
    in the Go world, where it was said to be impossible for a machine to beat a human;
    the number of people who feel anxious might increase. However, although the news
    that a machine has beaten a human could be taken as a negative if you just focus
    on the fact that "a machine won," this is definitely not negative news. Rather,
    it is great news for humankind. Why? Here are two reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first reason is that the Google DeepMind Challenge Match was a match in
    which the human was handicapped. Not only for Go, but also for card games or sports
    games, we usually do research about what tactics the opponents will use before
    a match, building our own strategy by studying opponents' action patterns. DeepMind,
    of course, has studied professional Go players' tactics and how to play, whereas
    humans couldn't study enough about how a machine plays, as DeepMind continued
    studying and kept changing its action patterns until the last minutes before the
    Google DeepMind Challenge Match. Therefore, it can be said that there was an information
    bias or handicap. It was great that Lee SeDol won one match with these handicaps.
    Also, it indicates that AI will develop further.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other reason is that we have found that a machine is not likely to destroy
    the value of humans, but instead to promote humans' further growth. In the Google
    DeepMind Challenge Match, a machine used a strategy which a human had not used
    before. This fact was a huge surprise to us, but at the same time, it meant that
    we found a new thing which humans need to study. Deep learning is obviously a
    great technology, but we shouldn't forget that neural networks involve an algorithm
    which imitates the structure of a human brain. In other words, its fundamentals
    are the same as a human's patterns of thinking. A machine can find out an oversight
    of patterns which the human brain can't calculate by just adding the speed of
    calculation. AlphaGo can play a game against AlphaGo using the input study data,
    and learns from the result of that game too. Unlike a human, a machine can proceed
    to study for 24 hours, so it can gain new patterns rapidly. Then, a whole new
    pattern will be found by a machine during that process, which can be used for
    humans to study Go further. By studying a new strategy which wouldn't been found
    just by a human, our Go world will expand and we can enjoy Go even more. Needless
    to say, it is not only machines that learn, but also humans. In various fields,
    a machine will discover new things which a human hasn't ever noticed, and every
    time humans face that new discovery, they too advance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI and humans are in a complementary relationship. To reiterate, a machine is
    good at calculating huge numbers of patterns and finding out a pattern which hasn't
    been discovered yet. This is way beyond human capability. On the other hand, AI
    can't create a new idea from a completely new concept, at least for now. On the
    contrary, this is the area where humans excel. A machine can judge things only
    within given knowledge. For example, if AI is only given many kinds of dog images
    as input data, it can answer what kind of dog it is, but if it's a cat, then AI
    would try its best to answer the kind of dog, using its knowledge of dogs.

    answer from its gained knowledge. Thinking what knowledge should be given for
    AI to make progress is a human''s task. If you give new knowledge, again AI will
    calculate the most likely answer from the given knowledge with quite a fast pace.
    People also have different interests or knowledge depending on the environment
    in which they grow up, which is the same for AI. Meaning, what kind of *personality*
    the AI has or whether the AI becomes good or evil for humans depends on the person/people
    the AI has contact with. One such typical example, in which AI was grown in the
    wrong way, is the AI developed by Microsoft called Tay (`https://www.tay.ai`).

    these past few years, the technology of AI has got huge attention, which can be
    one of the factors to speed up the development of AI technology further. Now,
    the next action that should be taken is to think how AI and humans interact with
    each other. AI itself is just one of many technologies. Technology can become
    good or evil depending on how humans use it; therefore, we should be careful how
    we control that technology, otherwise it's possible that the whole AI field will
    be shrinking in the future. AI is becoming particularly good within certain narrow
    fields, but it is far from overwhelming, and far from what science fiction currently
    envisions. How AI will evolve in the future depends on our use of knowledge and
    technology management.

    slow down the speed of its development. Considering recent booms of bots, as seen
    in the story that Facebook is going to launch Bot Store ([http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/17/facebooks-messenger-in-a-bot-store/](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/17/facebooks-messenger-in-a-bot-store/)),
    we can easily imagine that the interaction between a user and an application would
    become a chat-interface base, and AI would mingle with the daily life of an ordinary
    user going forward. For more people to get familiar with AI, we should develop
    AI technology further and make it more convenient for people to use.
