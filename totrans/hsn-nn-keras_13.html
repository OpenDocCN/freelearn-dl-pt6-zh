<p class="mce-root"><span>This section familiarizes the reader </span>with how to use the latest research and developments, reviewed as a plateau to scientifically speculate on the future of deep learning and AI.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We take the perspective of programmers, and scientists, and employ sheer intuition to see how this topic may develop in the future, pointing out potentially new and unexplored paths for research, and business development alike. The implications for generative models and autoencoders will also be used to generate custom artificial images, and topics such as vid2vid, deep fakes, and deep voice, will be examined.</p>
<p>This section only comprises a single chapter:</p>
