- en: Machine learning has made a huge impact on academia and industry by turning
    data into actionable intelligence. Scala, on the other hand, has been observing
    a steady rise in its adoption over the last few years, especially in the field
    of data science and analytics. This book has been written for data scientists,
    data engineers, and deep learning enthusiasts who have a solid background with
    complex numerical computing and want to learn more hands-on machine learning application
    development.

- en: So, if you're well-versed in machine learning concepts and want to expand your
    knowledge by delving into practical implementations using the power of Scala,
    then this book is what you need! Through 11 end-to-end projects, you will be acquainted
    with popular machine learning libraries such as Spark ML, H2O, Zeppelin, DeepLearning4j,
    and MXNet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After reading this book and practicing all of the projects, you will be able
    to dominate numerical computing, deep learning, and functional programming to
    carry out complex numerical tasks. You can thus develop, build, and deploy research
    and commercial projects in a production-ready environment.

- en: If you want to leverage the power of both Scala and open source libraries such
    as Spark ML, Deeplearning4j, H2O, MXNet, and Zeppelin to make sense of Big Data,
    then this book is for you. A strong understanding of Scala and the Scala Play
    Framework is recommended. Basic familiarity with ML techniques will be an added
    advantage.

    faster data processing and scalability. At least 8 GB RAM is recommended for standalone
    mode; use at least 32 GB RAM for a single VM and higher for a cluster. You should
    have enough storage for running heavy jobs (depending on the dataset size you
    will be handling); preferably, at least 50 GB of free disk storage (for standalone
    and for SQL Warehouse).
