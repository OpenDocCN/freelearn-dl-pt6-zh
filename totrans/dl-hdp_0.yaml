    to Deep Learning*, covers how deep learning has gained its popularity over the
    last decade and is now growing even faster than machine learning due to its enhanced
    functionalities. This chapter starts with an introduction of the real-life applications
    of Artificial Intelligence, the associated challenges, and how effectively Deep
    learning is able to address all of these. The chapter provides an in-depth explanation
    of deep learning by addressing some of the major machine learning problems such
    as, The curse of dimensionality, Vanishing gradient problem, and the likes. To
    get started with deep learning for the subsequent chapters, the classification
    of various deep learning networks is discussed in the latter part of this chapter.
    This chapter is primarily suitable for readers, who are interested to know the
    basics of deep learning without getting much into the details of individual deep
    neural networks.'

    Data"), *Distributed Deep Learning for Large - Scale Data*, explains that big
    data and deep learning are undoubtedly the two hottest technical trends in recent
    days. Both of them are critically interconnected and have shown tremendous growth
    in the past few years. This chapter starts with how deep learning technologies
    can be furnished with massive amount of unstructured data to facilitate extraction
    of valuable hidden information out of them. Famous technological companies such
    as Google, Facebook, Apple, and the like are using this large-scale data in their
    deep learning projects to train some aggressively deep neural networks in a smarter
    way. Deep neural networks, however, show certain challenges while dealing with
    Big data. This chapter provides a detailed explanation of all these challenges.
    The latter part of the chapter introduces Hadoop, to discuss how deep learning
    models can be implemented using Hadoop''s YARN and its iterative Map-reduce paradigm.
    The chapter further introduces Deeplearning4j, a popular open source distributed
    framework for deep learning and explains its various components.'

    Neural Network*,introduces Convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep neural network
    widely used by top technological industries in their various deep learning projects.
    CNN comes with a vast range of applications in various fields such as image recognition,
    video recognition, natural language processing, and so on. Convolution, a special
    type of mathematical operation, is an integral component of CNN. To get started,
    the chapter initially discusses the concept of convolution with a real-life example.
    Further, an in-depth explanation of Convolutional neural network is provided by
    describing each component of the network. To improve the performance of the network,
    CNN comes with three most important parameters, namely, sparse connectivity, parameter
    sharing, and equivariant representation. The chapter explains all of these to
    get a better grip on CNN. Further, CNN also possesses few crucial hyperparameters,
    which help in deciding the dimension of output volume of the network. A detailed
    discussion along with the mathematical relationship among these hyperparameters
    can be found in this chapter. The latter part of the chapter focuses on distributed
    convolutional neural networks and shows its implementation using Hadoop and Deeplearning4j.'

    Network*, explains that it is a special type of neural network that can work over
    long sequences of vectors to produce different sequences of vectors. Recently,
    they have become an extremely popular choice for modeling sequences of variable
    length. RNN has been successfully implemented for various applications such as
    speech recognition, online handwritten recognition, language modeling, and the
    like. The chapter provides a detailed explanation of the various concepts of RNN
    by providing essential mathematical relations and visual representations. RNN
    possesses its own memory to store the output of the intermediate hidden layer.
    Memory is the core component of the recurrent neural network, which has been discussed
    in this chapter with an appropriate block diagram. Moreover, the limitations of
    uni-directional recurrent neural networks are provided, and to overcome the same,
    the concept of bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is introduced. Later,
    to address the problem of vanishing gradient, introduced in chapter 1, a special
    unit of RNN, called Long short-term Memory (LSTM) is discussed. In the end, the
    implementation of distributed deep recurrent neural network with Hadoop is shown
    with Deeplearning4j.'

    Boltzmann Machines*,covers both the models discussed in chapters 3 and 4 and explains
    that they are discriminative models. A generative model called Restricted Boltzmann
    machine (RBM) is discussed in chapter 5\. RBM is capable of randomly producing
    visible data values when hidden parameters are supplied to it. The chapter starts
    with introducing the concept of an Energy-based model, and explains how Restricted
    Boltzmann machines are related to it. Furthermore, the discussion progresses towards
    a special type of RBM known as Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann machine, which
    is a combination of both Convolution and Restricted Boltzmann machines, and facilitates
    in the extraction of the features of high dimensional images.'

    using Hadoop. The implementation of RBM as well as distributed DBN using Deeplearning4j
    is discussed in the end of the chapter.

    one more generative model called autoencoder, which is generally used for dimensionality
    reduction, feature learning, or extraction. The chapter starts with explaining
    the basic concept of autoencoder and its generic block diagram.  The core structure
    of an autoencoder is basically divided into two parts, encoder and decoder. The
    encoder maps the input to the hidden layer, whereas the decoder maps the hidden
    layer to the output layer. The primary concern of a basic autoencoder is to copy
    certain aspects of the input layer to the output layer. The next part of the chapter
    discusses a type of autoencoder called sparse autoencoder, which is based on the
    distributed sparse representation of the hidden layer. Going further, the concept
    of deep autoencoder, comprising multiple encoders and decoders is explained in-depth
    with an appropriate example and block diagram. As we proceed, denoising autoencoder
    and stacked denoising autoencoder are explained in the latter part of the chapter.
    In conclusion, chapter 6 also shows the implementation of stacked denoising autoencoder
    and deep autoencoder in Hadoop using Deeplearning4j.'

    large-scale image processing, and natural language processing (NLP) with Hadoop.
    It explains how the large-scale video and image datasets can be deployed in Hadoop
    Distributed File System (HDFS) and processed with Map-reduce algorithm. For NLP,
    an in-depth explanation of the design and implementation is provided at the end
    of the chapter.'
