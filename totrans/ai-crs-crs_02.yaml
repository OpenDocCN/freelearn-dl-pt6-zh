- en: In the previous chapter, you began your AI journey. Before you continue it,
    you need your AI toolkit. This book is not just theory; it also contains an easy-to-use
    toolkit of all the AI models as Python files, ready to run thanks to the amazing
    Google Colaboratory platform that you will also be introduced to in this chapter.

- en: To fill your AI toolkit, I've prepared a GitHub page containing all the AI implementations
    for you to download, and Google Colab links of the Python notebooks containing
    the implementations, all ready to execute via an easy plug and play process.

    requires no setup and runs entirely on the cloud. It contains all the pre-installed
    packages required for your AI implementations so that they are ready to run with
    a simple plug and play process. By plug, I just mean to copy and paste the code
    inside a new Colab file (I'll explain how to open one next), and by play, I just
    mean to click on the play button (an example of that follows).

    the right basic coding knowledge. This is truly important before becoming a master
    at AI. If you have little or no experience with Python, make sure that you learn
    Python in *Chapter 3*, *Python Fundamentals – Learn How to Code in Python*, as
    a last preparation phase before you begin exploring the robot world.

    not only the many AI models of this book, but also the very user-friendly Google
    Colaboratory environment. You saw how easy it was to plug and play our models
    from GitHub to Colaboratory. Now you just need coding skills to make you ready
    to begin the real journey. In the next chapter, you will have a chance to learn—or brush
    up on—your Python fundamentals.
