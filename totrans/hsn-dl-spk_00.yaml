- en: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on multilayer neural networks
    that can solve particularly hard and large-scale problems in areas such as natural
    language processing and image classification. This book addresses the sheer complexity
    of the technical and analytical parts, and the speed at which deep learning solutions
    can be implemented on top of Apache Spark.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with an explanation of the fundamentals of Apache Spark and
    deep learning (how to set up Spark for deep learning, the principles of distributed
    modeling, and different types of neural network). Then it moves to the implementation
    of some deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, on Spark. The readers
    will get hands-on experience of what it takes and a general feeling of the complexity
    of what they are dealing with. During the course of the book, popular deep learning
    frameworks such as DeepLearning4J (mostly), Keras, and TensorFlow will be used
    to implement and train distributed models.

- en: A basic knowledge of the Scala programming language is required in order to
    understand the hands-on topics throughout this book. Basic knowledge of machine
    learning will also be helpful for a better understanding of the deep learning
    theory. Preliminary knowledge or experience with Apache Spark isn't necessary,
    as the first chapter covers all of the topics regarding the Spark ecosystem. A
    good knowledge of Python is required only in order to understand the Keras and
    TensorFlow models that can be imported in DL4J.
