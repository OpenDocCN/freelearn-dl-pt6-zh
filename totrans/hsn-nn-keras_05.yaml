    pooling layers that may be used in neural networks to process sensory input, from
    images on your laptop, to databases and real-time IoT applications. Readers will
    learn about using pretrained models, such as LeNet, and partial convolutional
    networks for image and video reconstruction on Keras, gain insights into how to
    deploy models using REST APIs, and then embed them in Raspberry computing devices
    for custom use cases, such as photography, surveillance, and inventory management.

    networks in detail and learn how to implement core and extended layers in Keras
    for desired outcomes.

    networks and what it means to be a Turing-complete algorithm, examine specific
    consequences of backpropagation through time, including the issues of vanishing
    gradients, and obtain a comprehensive understanding of how temporal information
    is captured in such models.

    in detail, known as **Long Short-Term Memory** (**LSTM**), and become familiar
    with yet another neural network architecture that was inspired by our own biology.
