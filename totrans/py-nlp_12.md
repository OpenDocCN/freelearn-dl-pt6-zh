# Installation Guide

This appendix provides you with information related to the installation of Python libraries, as well as single-node Hadoop clusters, and single-node Spark clusters. If you want to ask me questions related to this book or any NLP-related questions, you can join me on Gitter.

# Installing Python, pip, and NLTK

Pip stands for pip installs package or pip installs Python.

You can see how to install `pip` and `nltk` at this link:

[https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/blob/master/Appendix3/Installationdocs/App3_1_Install_python_pip_NLTK.md.](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/blob/master/Appendix3/Installationdocs/App3_1_Install_python_pip_NLTK.md)

Python has been preinstalled on Linux and macOS. I would recommend you to use Linux OS or macOS as it will be easy to set up any ML-related frameworks.

# Installing the PyCharm IDE

You can install the PyCharm community IDE for Linux OS by clicking on this link:

[https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/blob/master/Appendix3/Installationdocs/App3_2_Pycharm_installation_guide.md](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/blob/master/Appendix3/Installationdocs/App3_2_Pycharm_installation_guide.md).

# Installing dependencies

You can run the following command to install various Python dependencies for NLP projects:

```py
sudo pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

```

This is the link for the dependency file:

# Summary

This section's focus area was on giving you details about the installation of various libraries. I have also given the installation steps of various IDE's. To make your life easier, I have developed one pip requirement document. By running the previously given command, you will be able to install Python dependencies. I have given steps to install Hadoop and Spark on your machine, and run both of them in a single-node cluster. You can also get in touch with me if you want to ask me something about installation.
