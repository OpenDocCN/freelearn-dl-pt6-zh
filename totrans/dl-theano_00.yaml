    main challenge with neural nets is to connect the real world data to the input
    of a neural net, in particular for categorical and discrete data. This chapter
    presents an example on how to build an embedding space through training with Theano.'

    the dataset is too small and feature engineering would overfit the data. In this
    last case, extra amounts of unlabeled data train better features as a basis for

    where for training (forward + backward passes), Theano outperforms Torch and TensorFlow.
    Also, Theano crushes Torch and TensorFlow for smaller batch sizes with larger
    numbers of hidden units. For bigger batch size and hidden layer size, the differences
    are smaller since they rely more on the performance of CUDA, the underlying NVIDIA
    graphic library common to all frameworks. Last, in up-to-date *soumith benchmarks*
    ([https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks)),
    the fftconv in Theano performs the best on CPU, while the best performing convolution
    implementations on GPU, cuda-convnet2 and fbfft, are CUDA extension, the underlying
    library. These results should convince the reader that, although results are mixed,
    Theano plays a leading role in the speed competition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second point to prefer Theano rather than Torch is that it comes with a
    **rich ecosystem**, taking benefit from the Python ecosystem, but also from a
    large number of libraries that have been developed for Theano. This book will
    present two of them, Lasagne, and Keras. Theano and Torch are the most extensible
    frameworks both in terms of supporting various deep architectures but also in
    terms of supported libraries. Last, Theano has not a reputation to be complex
    to debug, contrary to other deep learning libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The third point makes Theano an uncomparable tool for the computer scientist
    because it is not specific to deep learning. Although Theano presents the same
    methods for deep learning than other libraries, its underlying principles are
    very different: in fact, Theano compiles the computation graph on the target architecture.
    This compilation step makes Theano''s specificity, and it should be defined as
    a **mathematical expression compiler**, designed with machine learning in mind.
    The symbolic differentiation is one of the most useful features that Theano offers
    for implementing non-standard deep architectures. Therefore, Theano is able to
    address a much larger range of numerical problems, and can be used to find the
    solution that minimizes any problem expressed with a differentiable loss or energy
    function, given an existing dataset.'
