- en: Caffe2 is a popular deep learning framework designed with a focus on scalability,
    high performance, and portability. Written in C++, it has both a C++ API and a
    Python API. This book is a guide for you to quickly get started with Caffe2\.
    It will cover the topics of installing Caffe2, composing networks using its operators,
    training models, and deploying models to inference engines, devices at the edge,
    and the cloud. It will also show you how to work with Caffe2 and other deep learning
    frameworks using the ONNX interchange format.

    to Accelerators for Inference*, talks about inference engines and how they are
    an essential tool for the final deployment of a trained Caffe2 model on accelerators.
    We focus on two types of popular accelerators: NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs. We
    look at how to install and use TensorRT for deploying our Caffe2 model on NVIDIA
    GPUs. We also look at the installation and use of OpenVINO for deploying our Caffe2
    model on Intel CPUs and accelerators.'

    and in the cloud*, covers two applications of Caffe2 to demonstrate its ability
    to scale. As an application of Caffe2 with edge devices, we look at how to build
    Caffe2 on Raspberry Pi single-board computers and how to run Caffe2 applications
    on them. As an application of Caffe2 with the cloud, we look at the use of Caffe2
    in Docker containers.'
