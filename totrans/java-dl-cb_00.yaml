- en: Deep learning has helped many industries/companies to solve big challenges,
    enhance their products, and strengthen their infrastructure. The advantage of
    deep learning is that you neither have to design decision-making algorithms nor
    make decisions regarding important dataset features. Your neural network is capable
    of doing both. We have seen enough theoretical books that leave the audience all
    at sea having explained complex concepts. It is also important to know how/when
    you can apply what you have learned, especially in relation to enterprise. This
    is a concern for advanced technologies such as deep learning. You may have undertaken
    capstone projects, but you also want to take your knowledge to the next level.

- en: Of course, there are best practices in enterprise development that we may not
    cover in this book. We don't want readers to question themselves about the purpose
    of developing an application if it is too tedious to deploy in production. We
    want something very straightforward, targeting the largest developer community
    in the world. We have used **DL4J** (short for **Deeplearning4j**) throughout
    this book to demonstrate examples for the same reason. It has DataVec for **ETL**
    (short for **Extract, Transform, and Load**), ND4J as a scientific computation
    library, and a DL4J core library to develop and deploy neural network models in
    production. There are cases where DL4J outperforms some of the major deep learning
    libraries on the market. We are not degrading other libraries, as it all depends
    on what you want to do with them. You may also try accommodating multiple libraries
    in different phases if you don't want to bother switching to multiple technical
    stacks.

- en: In order to get the most out of this book, we recommend that readers have basic
    knowledge of deep learning and data analytics. It is also preferable for readers
    to have basic knowledge of MLP (multilayer perceptrons) or feed forward networks,
    recurrent neural networks, LSTM, word vector representations, and some level of
    debugging skills to interpret the errors from the error stack. As this book targets
    Java and the DL4J library, readers should also have sound knowledge of Java and
    DL4J. This book is not suitable for anyone who is new to programming or who doesn't
    have basic knowledge of deep learning.

    learning, and data analytics. Basic knowledge of deep learning will help you understand
    the neural network design and the various hyperparameters used in the examples. Basic
    data analytics skills and an understanding of data requirements will help you
    to explore DataVec better, while some prior knowledge of the basics of reinforcement
    learning will help you while working through [Chapter 9](9d49be5b-7d29-47f8-848d-b1c5c1b742e9.xhtml),
    *Using RL4J for Reinforcement Learning*. We will also be discussing distributed
    neural networks in [Chapter 10](32f8aeb2-2e66-48a6-ac6e-059450d6f3af.xhtml), *Developing
    Applications in a Distributed Environment*, for which basic knowledge of Apache
    Spark is preferred.
