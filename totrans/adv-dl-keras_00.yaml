- en: In recent years, deep learning has made unprecedented success stories in difficult
    problems in vision, speech, natural language processing and understanding, and all
    other areas with abundance of data. The interest in this field by companies, universities,
    governments, and research organizations has accelerated the advances in the field.
    This book covers select important advances in deep learning. The advanced theories
    are explained by giving a background of the principles, digging into the intuition
    behind the concepts, implementing the equations and algorithms using Keras, and
    examining the results.

- en: '**Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**), as it stands today, is still far from
    being a well-understood field. Deep learning, as a sub field of AI, is in the
    same position. While it is far from being a mature field, many real-world applications
    such as vision-based detection and recognition, product recommendation, speech
    recognition and synthesis, energy conservation, drug discovery, finance, and marketing
    are already using deep learning algorithms. Many more applications will be discovered
    and built. The aim of this book is to explain advanced concepts, give sample implementations,
    and let the readers, as experts in their field, identify the target applications.'

- en: A field that is not completely mature is a double-edged sword. On one edge,
    it offers a lot of opportunities for discovery and exploitation. There are many
    unsolved problems in deep learning. This translates into opportunities to be the
    first to market – product development, publication, or recognition. The other
    edge is that it would be difficult to trust a not completely well-understood field
    in a mission-critical environment. We can safely say that if asked, very few machine
    learning engineers will ride an auto-pilot plane controlled by a deep learning
    system. There is a lot of work to be done to gain this level of trust. The advanced
    concepts that are discussed in this book have a high chance of playing a major
    role as the foundation in gaining this level of trust.

- en: Every book in deep learning will not be able to completely cover the whole field.
    This book is not an exception. Given the time and space, we could have touched
    interesting areas such as detection, segmentation and recognition, visual understanding,
    probabilistic reasoning, natural language processing and understanding, speech
    synthesis, and automated machine learning. However, this book believes in choosing
    and explaining select areas so that readers can take up other fields that are
    not covered.

- en: The book is intended for machine learning engineers and students who would like
    to gain a better understanding of advanced topics in deep learning. Each discussion
    is supplemented with code implementation in Keras. This book is for readers who
    would like to understand how to translate theory into a working code implementation
    in Keras. Apart from understanding theories, code implementation is usually one
    of the difficult tasks in applying machine learning to real-world problems.
