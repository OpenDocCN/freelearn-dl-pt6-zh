<p class="mce-root">Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data. <em>Advanced Deep Learning with R</em> will help you understand popular deep learning architectures and their variants in R and provide real-life examples.</p>
<p>This book will help you apply deep learning algorithms in R using advanced examples. It covers variants of neural network models such as ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and others using expert techniques. In the course of reading this book, you will make use of popular deep learning libraries such as Keras-R, TensorFlow-R, and others to implement AI models.</p>

<p>The following are a few ideas for how you can get the most out of this book:</p>
<p>All examples in this book use R codes. So before getting started with it, you should havea good foundation in the R language. As per Confucius, "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." This is true for this book, too. A hands-on approach of working with the codes while going through the chapters will be very useful in understanding the deep learning models.</p>
<p>All the codes in this book were successfully run on a Mac computer that had 8 GB of RAM. However, if you are working with a much larger dataset compared to what has been used in this book for illustration purposes, more powerful computing resources may be required in order to develop deep learning models.  It will also be helpful to have a good foundation in statistical methods.</p>

<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>:<span> </span><span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles.<span> </span><span>Here is an example:</span><span> </span>"<span>We store the accuracy and loss values while fitting the model in </span><kbd>model_three</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>model %&gt;% <br/>   compile(loss = 'binary_crossentropy', <br/>   optimizer = 'adam',<br/>   metrics = 'accuracy')</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "<strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong> (<strong>RNNs</strong>) are well suited to working with data involving such sequences.</span><span>"</span></p>
