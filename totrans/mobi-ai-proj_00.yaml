- en: We're witnessing a revolution in **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**), thanks
    to breakthroughs in deep learning. *Mobile Artificial Intelligence Projects* empowers
    you to take part in this revolution by applying AI techniques to design applications
    for **natural language processing** (**NLP**), robotics, and computer vision.

- en: The book teaches you how to harness the power of AI in mobile applications,
    along with learning the core functions of NLP, neural networks, deep learning,
    and the Mobile Vision API. This book features a range of projects covering tasks
    such as automated reasoning, facial recognition, digital assistants, automatic
    text generation, and personalized news and stories. You will learn how to utilize
    NLP and machine learning algorithms to make applications more predictive, proactive,
    and capable of making autonomous decisions with less human input. In the concluding
    chapters, you will work with popular libraries such as TensorFlow Lite, CoreML,
    and the Snapdragon **Neural Processing Engine** (**NPE**) across the Android and
    iOS platforms.

- en: '[Chapter 1](1bfa8853-a79e-4b4a-aa9f-254392b158bb.xhtml), *Artificial Intelligence
    Concepts and Fundamentals*, covers the main concepts and high-level theory required
    to build AI applications on mobile or the web. We discuss the fundamentals of
    **Artificial Neural Networks** (**ANNs**) and deep learning, which form the crux
    of the current research and trends in AI. We will come to understand all the essential
    terms required to start our journey on building AI applications.'

    Price Prediction Mobile App*, is the practical primer for the entire book. We
    will look at all the essential tools and libraries used throughout the book, and
    consider how to set up a deep learning environment. We will introduce these by
    showing how to build a real-estate price prediction app using TensorFlow, deploying
    it for consumption on mobile and the web. For this, we will be using ANNs and
    TensorFlow.'

    Net Architectures to Recognize HandWritten Digits*, focuses on the essential theory,
    terms, and concepts associated with machine vision. We will get an intuitive understanding
    of how Convolutional Neural Networks (**CNNs**) work by applying machine vision
    in practice. We will gain an understanding of how to build real-world applications
    in machine vision. This chapter will be intuitive and application-focused, instead
    of theory-heavy.'

    Vision Mobile App to Classify Flower Species*, allows us to translate our learning
    from the previous chapters to build an object recognition app and then customize
    it to build an app to classify over 100 species of flowers and pull up their wiki
    pages. We will learn how to retrain existing Deepnet architectures for custom
    use cases in object and image classification.'

    restoration using AI. It discusses the deepnets and libraries used for these tasks.
    We will explore techniques used in deep learning to solve and execute these tasks
    individually, and then we''ll set up and run image restoration from Android and
