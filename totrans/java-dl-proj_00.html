<p>The continued growth in data, coupled with the need to make increasingly complex decisions against that data, is creating massive hurdles that prevent organizations from deriving insights in a timely manner using traditional analytical approaches.</p>
<p>To find meaningful values and insights, deep learning evolved, which is a branch of machine learning algorithms based on learning multiple levels of abstraction. Neural networks, being at the core of deep learning, are used in predictive analytics, computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and performing a myriad of other complex tasks.</p>
<p>Until date, most DL books available are written in Python. However, this book is conceived for developers, data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and deep learning enthusiasts who want to build powerful, robust, and accurate predictive models with the power of Deeplearning4j (a JVM-based DL framework), combining other open source Java APIs.  </p>
<p>Throughout the book, you will learn how to develop practical applications for AI systems using feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and factorization machines. Additionally, you will learn how to attain your deep learning programming on GPU in a distributed way.</p>
<p>After finishing the book, you will be familiar with machine learning techniques, in particular, the use of Java for deep learning, and will be ready to apply your knowledge in research or commercial projects.<span> </span>In summary, this book is not meant to be read cover to cover. You can jump to a chapter that looks like something you are trying to accomplish or one that simply ignites your interest.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Happy reading!</p>

<p>Developers, data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and deep learning enthusiasts who wish to learn how to develop real-life deep learning projects by harnessing the power of JVM-based Deeplearning4j (DL4J), Spark, RankSys, and other open source libraries will find this book extremely useful. A sound understanding of Java is needed. Nevertheless, some basic prior experience of Spark, DL4J, and Maven-based project management will be useful to pick up the concepts quicker.</p>

It then briefly discusses existing and emerging neural network architectures. Next, it covers various features of deep learning frameworks and libraries. Then it shows how to solve Titanic survival prediction using a Spark-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Finally, it discusses some frequent questions related to this projects and general DL area.</p>
<p><a href="e27fb252-7892-4659-81e2-2289de8ce570.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Cancer Types Prediction Using Recurrent Type Networks</em>, demonstrates how to develop a DL application for cancer type classification from a very-high-dimensional gene expression dataset. First, it performs necessary feature engineering such that the dataset can feed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Finally, it discusses some frequent questions related to this project and DL4J hyperparameters/nets tuning.</p>
<p><a href="5e051ef6-a3bf-4fe3-b888-8cebdb4240e6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Multi-Label</em> <em>Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks</em>, demonstrates how to develop an end-to-end project for handling the multi-label image classification problem using CNN on top of the DL4J framework on real Yelp image datasets.

A large-scale movie review dataset will be used to train the LSTM model, and Word2Vec will be used as the neural embedding. Finally, it shows sample predictions for other review datasets.</p>
<p><a href="2d4fc6f2-3753-456c-8774-3f41dbe13cfb.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Transfer Learning for Image Classification</em>, demonstrates how to develop an end-to-end project to solve dog versus cat image classification using a pre-trained VGG-16 model. We wrap up everything in a Java JFrame and JPanel application to make the overall pipeline understandable for making sample object detection.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Regarding operating system</strong>: Linux <span>distributions are preferable (including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS). To be more specific, for example, for Ubuntu it is recommended to have a 14.04 (LTS) 64-bit (or later) complete installation or VMWare player 12 or Virtual box.  You can run Spark jobs on Windows (XP/7/8/10) or Mac OS X (10.4.7+).</span></p>
<p><strong>Regarding hardware configuration</strong>: A machine or server having core i5 processor, about 100 GB disk space, and at least 16 GB RAM. In addition, an Nvidia GPU driver has to be installed with CUDA and CuDNN configured if you want to perform the training on GPU.

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Then, I unzipped and copied each </span><kbd>.csv</kbd><span> file into a folder called </span><kbd>label</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;properties&gt;<br/>  &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;<br/>  &lt;java.version&gt;1.8&lt;/java.version&gt;<br/>&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>&lt;properties&gt;</strong><br/>  &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;<br/>  &lt;java.version&gt;1.8&lt;/java.version&gt;<br/><strong>&lt;/properties&gt;</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "We then read and process images into <span class="packt_screen">PhotoID | Vector map</span></span><span>"</span></p>
