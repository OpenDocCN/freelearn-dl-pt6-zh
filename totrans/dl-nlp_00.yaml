- en: Applying deep learning approaches to various NLP tasks can take your computational
    algorithms to a completely new level in terms of speed and accuracy. deep learning
    for natural language processing starts off by highlighting the basic building
    blocks of the natural language processing domain. The book goes on to introduce
    the problems that you can solve using state-of-the-art neural network models.
    Delving into the various neural network architectures and their specific areas
    of application will help you to understand how to select the best model to suit
    your needs. As you advance through this deep learning book, you'll study convolutional,
    recurrent, and recursive neural networks, in addition to covering long short-term
    memory networks (LSTM). In the later chapters, you will be able to develop applications
    using NLP techniques such as attention model and beam search.

    processing, but you will also be able to select the best text pre-processing and
    neural network models to solve a number of NLP issues.

- en: Deep learning for natural language processing will start with the very basic
    concepts of natural language processing. Once the basic concepts are introduced,
    the audience will gradually be made aware of the applications and problems in
    the real world where NLP techniques are applicable. Once the user understands
    the problem domain, the approach for developing the solution will be introduced.
    As part of solution-based approach, basic building blocks of Neural Networks are
    discussed. Eventually, modern architectures of various Neural Networks are elaborated
    with their corresponding application areas with examples.
