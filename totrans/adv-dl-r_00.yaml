- en: Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that
    attempt to model high-level abstractions in data. *Advanced Deep Learning with
    R* will help you understand popular deep learning architectures and their variants
    in R and provide real-life examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will help you apply deep learning algorithms in R using advanced examples.
    It covers variants of neural network models such as ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and others
    using expert techniques. In the course of reading this book, you will make use
    of popular deep learning libraries such as Keras-R, TensorFlow-R, and others to
    implement AI models.

    should havea good foundation in the R language. As per Confucius, "I hear and
    I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." This is true for this
    book, too. A hands-on approach of working with the codes while going through the
    chapters will be very useful in understanding the deep learning models.

    8 GB of RAM. However, if you are working with a much larger dataset compared to
    what has been used in this book for illustration purposes, more powerful computing
    resources may be required in order to develop deep learning models.  It will also
    be helpful to have a good foundation in statistical methods.
