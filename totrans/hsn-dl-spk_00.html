<p class="mce-root">Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on multilayer neural networks that can solve particularly hard and large-scale problems in areas such as natural language processing and image classification. This book addresses the sheer complexity of the technical and analytical parts, and the speed at which deep learning solutions can be implemented on top of Apache Spark.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book starts with an explanation of the fundamentals of Apache Spark and deep learning (how to set up Spark for deep learning, the principles of distributed modeling, and different types of neural network). Then it moves to the implementation of some deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, on Spark. The readers will get hands-on experience of what it takes and a general feeling of the complexity of what they are dealing with. During the course of the book, popular deep learning frameworks such as DeepLearning4J (mostly), Keras, and TensorFlow will be used to implement and train distributed models.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The mission of this book is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a hands-on guide to implementing Scala (and in some cases, Python too) deep learning solutions that scale and perform</li>
<li>To make readers confident with using Spark via several code examples</li>
<li>To explain how to choose the model that best addresses a particular deep learning problem or scenario</li>
</ul>

<p>A basic knowledge of the Scala programming language is required in order to understand the hands-on topics throughout this book. Basic knowledge of machine learning will also be helpful for a better understanding of the deep learning theory. Preliminary knowledge or experience with Apache Spark isn't necessary, as the first chapter covers all of the topics regarding the Spark ecosystem. A good knowledge of Python is required only in order to understand the Keras and TensorFlow models that can be imported in DL4J.</p>
<p>In order to build and execute the code examples in this book, Scala 2.11.x, Java 8, Apache Maven, and your IDE of choice are required.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>val spark = SparkSession<br/>     .builder<br/>       .appName("StructuredNetworkWordCount")<br/>       .master(master)<br/>       .getOrCreate()</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>-------------------------------------------<br/> <strong>Time: 1527457655000 ms</strong><br/> -------------------------------------------<br/> (consumer,1)<br/> (Yet,1)<br/> (another,1)<br/> (message,2)<br/> (for,1)<br/> (the,1)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/server.properties</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
