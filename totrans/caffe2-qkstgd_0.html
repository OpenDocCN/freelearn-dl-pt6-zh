<p>Caffe2 is a popular deep learning framework <span>designed with a focus on scalability, high performance, and portability. Written in C++, it has both a C++ API and a Python API. This book is a guide for you to quickly get started with Caffe2. It will cover the topics of installing Caffe2, composing networks using its operators, training models, and deploying models to inference engines, devices at the edge, and the cloud. It will also show you how to work with Caffe2 and other deep learning frameworks using the ONNX interchange format.</span></p>

<p><a href="5f3ecee9-fc6c-4a3f-bc8f-3bffb7cb2269.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction and Installation</em>, introduces<span> Caffe2 and examines how to build and install it.</span></p>
<p><a href="270a3617-74cd-4e64-98f7-eb0c4e3cbcf6.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Composing Networks</em>, <span>teaches you about Caffe2 operators and how to compose them to build a simple computation graph and a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.</span></p>
<p><a href="3c2dd7d3-b762-49a3-a5d6-0b791eadadb2.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Training Networks</em>, gets into<span> how to use Caffe2 to compose a network for training and how to train a network to solve the MNIST problem.</span></p>
<p><a href="95863955-3504-48ab-a217-e95339a754d3.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Working with Caffe</em>, explores<span> the relationship between Caffe and Caffe2 and how to work with models trained in Caffe.</span></p>
<p><a href="4481e225-7882-4625-9d42-63ba41e74b4f.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Working with Other Frameworks</em>, looks<span> at contemporary deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch and how we can exchange models from and to Caffe2 and these other frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="800ca2c2-fb20-4ad3-9268-12bb0aa83b8a.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Deploying Models to Accelerators for Inference</em>, talks<span> about inference engines and how they are an essential tool for the final deployment of a trained Caffe2 model on accelerators. We focus on two types of popular accelerators: NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs. We look at how to install and use TensorRT for deploying our Caffe2 model on NVIDIA GPUs. We also look at the installation and use of OpenVINO for deploying our Caffe2 model on Intel CPUs and accelerators.</span></p>
<p><a href="91e4cdcf-24f6-4426-ac95-b6845c020d83.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Caffe2 at the Edge and in the cloud</em>, covers<span> two applications of Caffe2 to demonstrate its ability to scale. As an application of Caffe2 with edge devices, we look at how to build Caffe2 on Raspberry Pi single-board computers and how to run Caffe2 applications on them. As an application of Caffe2 with the cloud, we look at the use of Caffe2 in Docker containers.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The output values of a </span><kbd>SoftMax</kbd><span> function have nice properties</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>model = model_helper.ModelHelper("MatMul model")<br/>model.net.MatMul(["A", "B"], "C")</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo apt-get update</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: " For example, for Ubuntu, it gives me the option of downloading a</span> <span class="packt_screen">Customizable Package</span> <span>or a single large</span> <span class="packt_screen">Full Package</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
