    systems, self-driving cars, medical discoveries, innovative e-commerce, and many
    more. This book gets you started with the building blocks of CNNs, while also
    guiding you through the best practices for implementing real-life CNN models and
    solutions. You will learn to create innovative solutions for image and video analytics
    to solve complex machine learning and computer vision problems.

    image classification, and walks you through building your first CNN model. You
    will learn concepts such as transfer learning and autoencoders with CNN that will
    enable you to build very powerful models, even with limited supervised (labeled
    image) training data.

- en: This book is focused on building CNNs with Python programming language. We have
    used Python version 2.7 (2x) to build various applications and the open source
    and enterprise-ready professional software using Python, Spyder, Anaconda, and
    PyCharm. Many of the examples are also compatible with Python 3x. As a good practice,
    we encourage users to use Python virtual environments for implementing these codes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We focus on how to utilize various Python and deep learning libraries (Keras,
    TensorFlow, and Caffe) in the best possible way to build real-world applications.
    In that spirit, we have tried to keep all of the code as friendly and readable
    as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the
    code and readily use it in different scenarios.
