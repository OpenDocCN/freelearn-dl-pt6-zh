			</ol>
			<h2 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_230" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Exploring what's next for you in AI</h2>
			<p class="normal">You've come such a long way! Let's take a last step back and see what knowledge you've gained and what skills you've acquired:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">You have a solid intuition of Reinforcement Learning.</li>
				<li class="list">You can use it to solve real-world problems.</li>
				<li class="list">You can program in a way that sets you apart and puts you at the cutting edge of AI.</li>
				<li class="list">You can write systems that learn and improve over time.</li>
				<li class="list">You have the solid basics that allow you to go further in AI.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Speaking of going further, the question is: how? 
How will you apply what you've learned? What will you do next? First of 
all, your next step is:</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_231" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Practice, practice, and practice</h3>
			<p class="normal">There are many ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>practice
 your AI skills. You can enter AI competitions like the ones on Kaggle, 
which contain problems that can be solved with deep reinforcement 
learning. You could build some new AIs like the one we created for the 
self-driving car. For example, you could build <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>an AI with Kivy that plays the game of pong. There's a great AI platform, called <strong class="bold">OpenAI Gym</strong>, where you can practice building AIs for many types of applications, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">An AI that plays Atari games (Breakout, Pacman, Space Invaders, and so on).</li>
				<li class="list">An AI that plays car racing.</li>
				<li class="list">An AI that plays the game Doom.</li>
				<li class="list">Training a virtual robot on how to walk and run.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">I really recommend that you check out the Open AI 
Gym website, with all these fantastic applications you can work and 
practice on.</p>
			<p class="normal">Going further, what would be the next step for you 
to take in making an impact in this world? Do you remember the 10 
application fields of AI that we identified and explained in the 
introduction? Just pick your favorite! Pick the one that resonates 
the most with you. Let's remind you what they were:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="list" value="1">Energy</li>
				<li class="list">Healthcare</li>
				<li class="list">Transport and logistics</li>
				<li class="list">Education</li>
				<li class="list">Security</li>
				<li class="list">Employment</li>
				<li class="list">Smart homes and robots</li>
				<li class="list">Entertainment and happiness</li>
				<li class="list">Environment</li>
				<li class="list">Economy and business</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">If you have an interest or <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>passion
 in one of these fields, or even better some domain knowledge, you can 
combine that with your new AI skills to solve some problems in these 
industries. You can increase your impact by working with or in some tech
 companies, or by building your own one. There will always be massive 
demand for AI in each of these fields, which will always open many doors
 to you.</p>
			<p class="normal">Speaking of open doors, that brings me to another next step I recommend to you.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_232" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Networking</h3>
			<p class="normal">Practicing is a necessity, but it's definitely not 
enough to make an impact with AI in this world. You also have to 
network. Whether it's<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> working for a tech 
company, a company in another industry with an AI team, or for your own 
business, you should always network. This will open new doors, seed new 
opportunities, and increase your chances of success.</p>
			<p class="normal">Networking today is easy. There are many AI events 
and conferences that you can visit, and the closest one will never be 
too far from your place. If you can't get to one, you can easily 
organize some AI meetups and after-work sessions yourself, where you 
discuss AI with other passionate people. You can also create groups 
using social media, where you can exchange ideas, brainstorm AI 
problems, and perhaps establish new connections through which you form 
synergy. Again, the more you network, the more you get all these 
benefits: connections, generated ideas, synergies, opportunities, opened
 doors, and AI journeys.</p>
			<p class="normal">I want to finish this book by giving you my best 
advice for your professional life. The final recommendation I want to 
give you is the following.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_233" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Never stop learning</h3>
			<p class="normal">AI is a fast-evolving world so you must keep up to 
date on the latest state-of-the-art features. This book doesn't cover 
the latest breakthroughs in AI, but has given you the right basics and 
intuition for you to approach the latest developments in AI with 
confidence.</p>
			<p class="normal">The right basics are a necessity, but not enough 
for you to keep up over time. What you must do is never stop learning. 
The good news is that it's easy to keep learning today! There are many 
great MOOCs that cover the latest advanced models in AI, as well as 
articles, research papers, blogs, not to mention YouTube videos where 
you can find the entirety of whole AI theory explained from scratch up 
to the state-of-the-art models. You have plenty of options to feed your 
brain with up-to-date AI knowledge. Just make sure you don't pick the 
worst reviewed content, and you'll be fine.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's recap. What are your next steps after this book?</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="list" value="1">Practice, practice, and practice.</li>
				<li class="list">Cross your AI skills with a field of application that resonates with you the most.</li>
				<li class="list">Network.</li>
				<li class="list">Never stop <a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>learning.</li>
				<li class="list">And, of course, keep up the hard work!</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">Yes, hard work will always be essential. Remember 
this. Success is only the tip of the iceberg, under which is hidden a 
tremendous amount of hard work. But don't worry; as soon as you feel 
passionate about your work and the purpose you follow, work will never 
be too hard. It will, in fact, feel effortless. That's why my 
recommendation number 2 here is very important: if you manage to pick a 
domain that resonates with your purpose, then you'll have found your way
 to make an impact with passion. If your passion is pure AI, even 
better! Then you can leverage it to solve problems and tackle challenges
 in several fields of applications, which gives you the amazing 
opportunity to have a diversified career.</p>
			<p class="normal">On that note, I want to wish you a fantastic and 
very successful career. It was a great pleasure writing this book for 
you; my purpose is to democratize AI, and raise awareness among everyone
 that AI is an accessible technology that can make a difference for the 
better in this world. Thank you so much, and enjoy AI!</p>
