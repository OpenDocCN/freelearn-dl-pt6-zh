Every day, deep learning algorithms are used across different industries. Deep learning has provided a revolutionary step to actualize AI. While it is a revolutionary technique, deep learning is often thought to be complicated, and so it is often kept from much being known of its contents. Theories and concepts based on deep learning are not complex or difficult. In this book, we'll take a step-by-step approach to learn theories and equations for the correct understanding of deep learning. You will find implementations from scratch, with detailed explanations of the cautionary notes for practical use cases.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>We'll implement deep learning algorithms using Lambda Expressions, hence Java 8 or above is required. Also, we'll use the Java library DeepLearning4J 0.4 or above.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for Java developers who want to know about deep learning algorithms and wish to implement them in applications.</p><p>Since this book covers the core concepts of and approaches to both machine learning and deep learning, no previous experience in machine learning is required.</p><p>Also, we will implement deep learning algorithms with very simple codes, so elementary Java developers will also find this book useful for developing both their Java skills and deep learning skills.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Let's take a look at <code class="literal">CNNMnistExample.java</code> in the package of convolution."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;dependency&gt;
