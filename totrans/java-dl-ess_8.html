Now you know the basic technique of deep learning, so don't worry. On the other hand, development of deep learning is rapid and a new model might be developed tomorrow. Big news about AI or deep learning comes out one after the other every day. Since you have acquired the basic technique, you can learn about the upcoming new technologies on AI and deep learning quickly. Now, let's walk away from the details of techniques and think about what path the field of AI will or should take. What is the future of deep learning? For the closing chapter, let's think about that. We'll pick up the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Hot topics in the deep learning industry</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to manage AI technologies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to proceed the study of deep learning further</li></ul></div><p>As for the last topic, about further study, I will recommend a website about deep learning. You can stay ahead of the curve by thinking about what technology might come next, or leveraging the techniques you have learned to innovate, rather than following AI developments as they appear.</p><div class="section" title="Breaking news about deep learning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec39"/>Breaking news about deep learning</h1></div></div></div><p>Deep learning, which <a id="id511" class="indexterm"/>triggered the AI boom, can't stop its momentum. New results are reported each day. As mentioned in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Approaches to Practical Applications – Recurrent Neural Networks and More">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Approaches to Practical Applications – Recurrent Neural Networks and More</em></span>, many researchers compete on image recognition and natural language processing. Of course, deep learning is not limited to these two fields, but applies to many other fields. The outcome of these applications is very exciting.</p><p>In this AI boom, in March 2016, the Go world was shaken by one event. Go is a board game in which two players are trying to take over more territory than their opponent. The news of 'AI beating a human in Go' shocked not only Go players but also the whole world, when a machine, that is, AI, beat<a id="id512" class="indexterm"/> a human at Go. DeepMind (<a class="ulink" href="https://deepmind.com/">https://deepmind.com/</a>), which was bought by Google, has been developing the Go-playing AI, called AlphaGo, and AlphaGo<a id="id513" class="indexterm"/> has beaten world-class player Lee Sedol for a fourth time, to win the five-game series four games to one in Google's DeepMind Challenge Match. Each game was delivered on livestream via YouTube, and many people watched the games in real time. You can watch all five games on YouTube, if you haven't watched them yet:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Match 1</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Match 2</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-GsfyVCBu0</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Match 3</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUAmTYHEyM8</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Match 4</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Match 5</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpW10DPHeQ</a></li></ul></div><p>
In these games, the<a id="id514" class="indexterm"/> first match, Match 1, gained a particularly large amount of attention. Also, looking at the number of page views, which is more than 1.35 million, you can see that many people have watched the video of Match 4, which was the only match that AlphaGo lost to Lee Se-Dol. The following is an image which captured one scene of Match 1:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_01.jpg" alt="Breaking news about deep learning"/><div class="caption"><p>The moment AlphaGo beat Lee SeDol (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8</a>)</p></div></div><p>That was the moment at which not only researchers of AI, but also the world, were excited by AlphaGo; but why did this news got so much attention? For another board game example, in a chess match, Deep Blue, which was developed by IBM, beat the world chess champion in 1997. Of course, it became big news at that time, as this was also a moment when a machine beat a human. Why then, when this was not the first time a machine had beaten a human, was news of AlphaGo's triumph against Lee SeDol so world-shaking? What is the difference between Chess and Go? Well, the difference is in the complexity<a id="id515" class="indexterm"/> of the patterns of Go. In fact, Go has many more strategy patterns than Chess. In popular board games such as Chess, Shogi, and Go, the numbers of patterns to determine who wins or loses are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Chess: 10,120</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Shogi: 10,220</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Go: 10,360</li></ul></div><p>Even looking at the numbers, you can see how complicated the strategy of Go is and easily imagine that a machine also needs an enormous amount of calculation. Because of this huge number of patterns, until recently, people thought it was impossible for AlphaGo to beat a human, or that it would be 100 years or 200 years before AlphaGo would beat a human. It was considered impossible for a machine to calculate the patterns of Go within a realistic time. But now, in a matter of a few years, a machine has beaten a human. According to the Google research blog, 1.5 months before the DeepMind Challenge Match was held, DeepMind could predict the human's moves 57% of the time (<a class="ulink" href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">http://googleresearch.blogspot.jp/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html</a>). The fact that a machine won against a human definitely had an impact, but the fact that a machine could learn the strategy of Go within a realistic time was even more surprising. DeepMind applies deep neural networks with the combination of Monte Carlo tree search and reinforcement learning, which shows the width of the application range for the algorithm of deep neural networks.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Expected next actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec40"/>Expected next actions</h1></div></div></div><p>Since the <a id="id516" class="indexterm"/>news about AlphaGo was featured in the media, the AI boom has <a id="id517" class="indexterm"/>definitely had a boost. You might notice that you hear the words "deep learning" in the media more often recently. It can be said that the world's expectations of AI have been increased that much. What is interesting is that the term "deep learning," which was originally a technical term, is now used commonly in daily news. You can see that the image of the term <span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span> has been changing. Probably, until just a few years ago, if people heard about AI, many of them would have imagined an actual robot, but how about now? 'The term AI is now often used—not particularly consciously—with regard to software or applications, and is accepted as commonplace. This is nothing but an indication that the world has started to understand AI, which has been developed for research, correctly. If a technology is taken in the wrong direction, it generates repulsion, or some people start to develop the technology incorrectly; however, it seems that this boom in <a id="id518" class="indexterm"/>AI technology is going in<a id="id519" class="indexterm"/> a good direction so far.    </p><p>While we are excited about the development of AI, as a matter of course, some people feel certain fears or anxieties. It's easy to imagine that some people might think the world where machines dominate humans, like in sci-fi movies or novels, is coming sooner or later, especially after AlphaGo won over Lee SeDol in the Go world, where it was said to be impossible for a machine to beat a human; the number of people who feel anxious might increase. However, although the news that a machine has beaten a human could be taken as a negative if you just focus on the fact that "a machine won," this is definitely not negative news. Rather, it is great news for humankind. Why? Here are two reasons.</p><p>The first reason is that the Google DeepMind Challenge Match was a match in which the human was handicapped. Not only for Go, but also for card games or sports games, we usually do research about what tactics the opponents will use before a match, building our own strategy by studying opponents' action patterns. DeepMind, of course, has studied professional Go players' tactics and how to play, whereas humans couldn't study enough about how a machine plays, as DeepMind continued studying and kept changing its action patterns until the last minutes before the Google DeepMind Challenge Match. Therefore, it can be said that there was an information bias or handicap. It was great that Lee SeDol won one match with these handicaps. Also, it indicates that AI will develop further.</p><p>The other reason is that we have found that a machine is not likely to destroy the value of humans, but instead to promote humans' further growth. In the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a machine used a strategy which a human had not used before. This fact was a huge surprise to us, but at the same time, it meant that we found a new thing which humans need to study. Deep learning is obviously a great technology, but we shouldn't forget that neural networks involve an algorithm which imitates the structure of a human brain. In other words, its fundamentals are the same as a human's patterns of thinking. A machine can find out an oversight of patterns which the human brain can't calculate by just adding the speed of calculation. AlphaGo can play a game against AlphaGo using the input study data, and learns from the result of that game too. Unlike a human, a machine can proceed to study for 24 hours, so it can gain new patterns rapidly. Then, a whole new pattern will be found by a machine during that process, which can be used for humans to study Go further. By studying a new strategy which wouldn't been found just by a human, our Go world will expand and we can enjoy Go even more. Needless to say, it is not only machines that learn, but also humans. In various fields, a machine will discover new things which a human hasn't ever noticed, and every time humans face that new discovery, they too advance.</p><p>AI and humans<a id="id520" class="indexterm"/> are in a complementary relationship. To reiterate, a machine<a id="id521" class="indexterm"/> is good at calculating huge numbers of patterns and finding out a pattern which hasn't been discovered yet. This is way beyond human capability. On the other hand, AI can't create a new idea from a completely new concept, at least for now. On the contrary, this is the area where humans excel. A machine can judge things only within given knowledge. For example, if AI is only given many kinds of dog images as input data, it can answer what kind of dog it is, but if it's a cat, then AI would try its best to answer the kind of dog, using its knowledge of dogs. </p><p>AI is actually an innocent existence in a way, and it just gives the most likely answer from its gained knowledge. Thinking what knowledge should be given for AI to make progress is a human's task. If you give new knowledge, again AI will calculate the most likely answer from the given knowledge with quite a fast pace. People also have different interests or knowledge depending on the environment in which they grow up, which is the same for AI. Meaning, what kind of <span class="emphasis"><em>personality</em></span> the AI has or whether the AI becomes good or evil for humans depends on the person/people the AI has contact with. One such typical example, in which AI was grown in the wrong way, is the AI developed by Microsoft called <a id="id522" class="indexterm"/>Tay (<code class="literal">https://www.tay.ai</code>). On March 23, 2016, Tay appeared on Twitter with the following tweet: <span class="emphasis"><em>hellooooooo world!!!</em></span>
</p><p>Tay gains knowledge from the interaction between users on Twitter and posts new tweets. This trial itself is quite interesting.</p><p>However, immediately after it was made open to the public, the problem occurred. On Twitter, users played a prank on Tay by inputting discriminatory knowledge into its account. Because of this, Tay has grown to keep posting tweets including expressions of sexual discrimination. And only one day after Tay appeared on Twitter, Tay disappeared from Twitter, leaving the following tweet: <span class="emphasis"><em>c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx</em></span>.</p><p>If you visit Tay's Twitter account's page (<a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/tayandyou">https://twitter.com/tayandyou</a>), tweets are protected and you can't see them anymore:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_05.jpg" alt="Expected next actions"/><div class="caption"><p>The Twitter account of Tay is currently closed</p></div></div><p>This is exactly<a id="id523" class="indexterm"/> the result of AI being given the wrong training by <a id="id524" class="indexterm"/>humans. In these past few years, the technology of AI has got huge attention, which can be one of the factors to speed up the development of AI technology further. Now, the next action that should be taken is to think how AI and humans interact with each other. AI itself is just one of many technologies. Technology can become good or evil depending on how humans use it; therefore, we should be careful how we control that technology, otherwise it's possible that the whole AI field will be shrinking in the future. AI is becoming particularly good within certain narrow fields, but it is far from overwhelming, and far from what science fiction currently envisions. How AI will evolve in the future depends on our use of knowledge and technology management.</p><p>While we should definitely care about how to control the technology, we can't slow down the speed of its development. Considering recent booms of bots, as seen in the story that Facebook is going to<a id="id525" class="indexterm"/> launch Bot Store (<a class="ulink" href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/17/facebooks-messenger-in-a-bot-store/">http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/17/facebooks-messenger-in-a-bot-store/</a>), we can easily imagine that the interaction between a user and an application would become a chat-interface base, and AI would mingle with the daily life of an ordinary user going forward. For more people to get familiar with AI, we should develop AI technology further and make it more convenient for people to use.</p><p>Deep learning<a id="id526" class="indexterm"/> and AI have got more attention, which means that if you <a id="id527" class="indexterm"/>would like to produce an outstanding result in this field, you are likely to find fierce competition. It's highly likely that an experiment you would like to work on might already be being worked on by someone else. The field of deep learning is becoming a world of such high competition as start-ups. If you own huge data, you might take advantage by analyzing that data, but otherwise, you need to think about how to experiment with limited data. Still, if you would like to get outstanding performance, it might be better for you to always bear the following in mind:</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"/>Tip</h3><p>Deep learning can only judge things within the knowledge given by training.</p></div></div><p>Based on this, you might get an interesting result by taking the following two approaches: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Experiment with data which can easily produce both input data and output data for training and testing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use completely different types of data, for training and test respectively, in an experiment</li></ul></div><p>For the first approach, for example, you can check automatic colorization using CNN. It was<a id="id528" class="indexterm"/> introduced in the project open to the public online at <a class="ulink" href="http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/">http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/</a> or in the dissertation at <a class="ulink" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511v1.pdf</a>. The idea is to color gray-scale images automatically. If you have any colored images – these should be obtained very easily – you can generate grayscale images just by writing quick scripts. With that, you have now prepared input data and output data for training. Being able to prepare lots of data means you can test easier and get high precision more often. The following is one of the examples of the tests:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_09.jpg" alt="Expected next actions"/><div class="caption"><p>Both are cited from <a class="ulink" href="http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/">http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/</a>
</p></div></div><p>Inputs to the <a id="id529" class="indexterm"/>model are the grayscale images on the left, outputs are the<a id="id530" class="indexterm"/> middle, and the images on the right are the ones with true color.</p><p>For the second approach, using completely different types of data, for training and testing respectively, in an experiment, we intentionally provide data which the AI doesn't know and make the gap between a random answer and a correct answer interesting/fun. For example, in <span class="emphasis"><em>Generating Stories about Images</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://medium.com/@samim/generating-stories-about-images-d163ba41e4ed">https://medium.com/@samim/generating-stories-about-images-d163ba41e4ed</a>), they have provided an image of a sumo wrestler to neural networks, which have only studied one of the projects and introduces the following: romantic novels and then test what the neural networks think. The result is as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_08.jpg" alt="Expected next actions"/><div class="caption"><p>Cited from <a class="ulink" href="https://medium.com/@samim/generating-stories-about-images-d163ba41e4ed">https://medium.com/@samim/generating-stories-about-images-d163ba41e4ed</a>
</p></div></div><p>This experiment <a id="id531" class="indexterm"/>itself is based on the approach called <code class="literal">neural-storyteller</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller">https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller</a>), but since the given data has an idea, it got the interesting result. As such, adding your new idea to <a id="id532" class="indexterm"/>an already developed approach would be an approach which <a id="id533" class="indexterm"/>could also get an interesting result.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Useful news sources for deep learning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec41"/>Useful news sources for deep learning</h1></div></div></div><p>Well, lastly, let's <a id="id534" class="indexterm"/>pick up two websites which would be useful for watching the movement of deep learning going forward and for learning more and more new knowledge. It will help your study.</p><p>The first one <a id="id535" class="indexterm"/>is <span class="strong"><strong>GitXiv</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://gitxiv.com/">http://gitxiv.com/</a>). The top page is as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_02.jpg" alt="Useful news sources for deep learning"/></div><p>In GitXiv, there<a id="id536" class="indexterm"/> are mainly articles based on papers. But in addition <a id="id537" class="indexterm"/>to the links to papers, it sets the links to codes which were used for tests, hence you can shorten your research time. Of course, it updates new experiments one after another, so you can watch what approach is major or in which field deep learning is hot now. It sends the most updated information constantly if you register your e-mail address. You should try it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_03.jpg" alt="Useful news sources for deep learning"/></div><p>The<a id="id538" class="indexterm"/> second one is <span class="strong"><strong>Deep Learning News</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://news.startup.ml/">http://news.startup.ml/</a>). This is<a id="id539" class="indexterm"/> a collection of links <a id="id540" class="indexterm"/>for deep learning and machine learning related topics. It has the same UI as <span class="strong"><strong>Hacker News</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a>), which <a id="id541" class="indexterm"/>deals with news for the whole <a id="id542" class="indexterm"/>technology industry, so if you know Hacker News, you should be familiar with the layout:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04779_08_04.jpg" alt="Useful news sources for deep learning"/></div><p>The<a id="id543" class="indexterm"/> information on Deep Learning News is not updated that frequently, but it has tips not only for implementation or technique, but also tips for what field you can use for deep learning, and has deep learning and machine learning related event information, so it can be useful for ideation or inspiration. If you take a brief look at the URL in the top page list, you might come up with good ideas.</p><p>There are more useful websites, materials, and communities other than the two we picked up here, such as<a id="id544" class="indexterm"/> the deep learning group on Google+ (<a class="ulink" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/112866381580457264725">https://plus.google.com/communities/112866381580457264725</a>), so you should watch the media which suit you. Anyway, now this industry is developing rapidly and it is definitely necessary to always watch out for updated information.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec42"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we went from the example of AlphaGo as breaking news to the consideration of how deep learning will or should develop. A machine winning over a human in some areas is not worthy of fear, but is an opportunity for humans to grow as well. On the other hand, it is quite possible that this great technology could go in the wrong direction, as seen in the example of Tay, if the technology of AI isn't handled appropriately. Therefore, we should be careful not to destroy this steadily developing technology. </p><p>The field of deep learning is one that has the potential for hugely changing an era with just one idea. If you build AI in the near future, that AI is, so to speak, a pure existence without any knowledge. Thinking what to teach AI, how to interact with it, and how to make use of AI for humankind is humans' work. You, as a reader of this book, will lead a new technology in the right direction. Lastly, I hope you will get actively involved in the cutting edge of the field of AI.</p></div></body></html>
