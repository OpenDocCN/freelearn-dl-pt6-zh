    more often these days. AI has become a hot topic not only in academic society,
    but also in the field of business. Large tech companies such as Google and Facebook
    have actively bought AI-related start-ups. Mergers and acquisitions in these AI
    areas have been especially active, with big money flowing into AI. The Japanese
    IT/mobile carrier company Softbank released a robot called Pepper in June 2014,
    which understands human feelings, and a year later they have started to sell Pepper
    to general consumers. This is a good movement for the field of AI, without a doubt.'

    is not that different to any other machine learning algorithm (don't worry if
    you don't know this, as we'll go through it later in the book). In fact, we can
    say that deep learning is the adaptation of neural networks, one of the algorithms
    of machine learning, which mimics the structure of a human brain. However, what
    deep learning can achieve is much more significant and different to any other
    machine learning algorithm, including neural networks. If you see what processes

- en: The first AI boom came in the late 1950s. Back then, the mainstream research
    and development of a search program was based on fixed rules—needless to say,
    they were human-defined. The search was, simply put, dividing cases. In this search,
    if we wanted a machine to perform any process, we had to write out every possible
    pattern we might need for the process. A machine can calculate much faster than
    a human can. It doesn't matter how enormous the patterns are, a machine can easily
    handle them. A machine will keep searching a million times and eventually will
    find the best answer. However, even if a machine can calculate at high speed,
    if it is just searching for an answer randomly and blindly it will take a massive
    amount of time. Yes, don't forget that constraint condition, "time." Therefore,
    further studies were conducted on how to make the search more efficient. The most
    popular search methods among the studies were **depth-first search** (**DFS**)
    and **breadth-first search** (**BFS**).

  zh: 第一次人工智能的热潮出现在1950年代末。当时，主流的搜索程序研发是基于固定规则——不用说，这些规则是由人类定义的。简单来说，搜索就是分割案例。在这种搜索中，如果我们希望机器执行某个过程，我们必须列出可能需要的每一种模式。机器的计算速度远远快于人类。无论模式有多庞大，机器都能够轻松处理。机器会不断地搜索一百万次，最终会找到最佳答案。然而，即便机器计算速度极快，如果只是盲目地随机搜索答案，仍然需要消耗大量的时间。是的，不要忘记那个限制条件，“时间”。因此，后续的研究聚焦于如何提高搜索效率。在这些研究中，最流行的搜索方法是**深度优先搜索**（**DFS**）和**广度优先搜索**（**BFS**）。
- en: 'Out of every possible pattern you can think of, search for the most efficient

    By doing this, you should get the best answer each time. Based on this hypothesis,
    two searching or traversing algorithms for a tree of graph data structures were
    developed: DFS and BFS. Both start at the root of a graph or tree, and DFS explores
    as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, whereas BFS explores
    the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors. Here are some

    Remember the tree-like model in the preceding diagram. From the top of the tree
    at the start of the game, there are 20 branches underneath as white's next possible
    move. Under one of these 20 branches, there's another 20 branches underneath as
    black's next possible movement, and so on. In this case, the tree has 20 x 20
    = 400 branches for black, depending on how white moves, 400 x 20 = 8,000 branches
    for white, 8,000 x 20 = 160,000 branches again for black, and... feel free to

    and embedded in a program, so the chess program is not as simple as previously
    thought, but we won't go into detail about this in this book. As you can see,
    it's not surprising that a machine can beat a human at Chess. A machine can evaluate
    and calculate massive amounts of patterns at the same time, in a much shorter

    all the world''s data has continued and is known as **Cyc** ([http://www.cyc.com/](http://www.cyc.com/)).
    Cyc''s ultimate purpose is to build an inference engine based on the database
    of this knowledge, called **knowledge base**. Here is an example of KR using the

    Even if the knowledge is structured and systemized, a machine understands it as
    a mark and never understands the concept. After all, the knowledge is input by
    a human and what a machine does is just compare the data and assume meaning based
    on the dictionary. For example, if you know the concept of "apple" and "green"
    and are taught "green apple = apple + green", then you can understand that "a
    green apple is a green colored apple" at first sight, whereas a machine can't.
    This is called the **symbol grounding problem** and is considered one of the biggest

    = 苹果 + 绿色”，那么你能够一眼看出“绿苹果是一种绿色的苹果”，而机器却做不到。这被称为**符号接地问题**，被认为是AI领域中最大的问题之一，也是框架问题。

    called machine learning. You should have heard the name if you have touched on
    data mining even a little. Machine learning is a strong tool compared to past
    AI approaches, which simply searched or assumed based on the knowledge given by
    a human, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, so machine learning is very advanced.
    Until machine learning, a machine could only search for an answer from the data
    that had already been inputted. The focus was on how fast a machine could pull
    out knowledge related to a question from its saved knowledge. Hence, a machine

    a question that can be answered with yes or no. For example, the question "What
    color do you like?" can be considered almost the same as asking "Do you like red?
    Do you like green? Do you like blue? Do you like yellow?..." In machine learning,
    using the ability to calculate and the capacity to process at high speed as a
    weapon, a machine utilizes a substantial amount of training data, replaces complex
    questions with yes/no questions, and finds out the regularity with which data
    is yes, and which data is no (in other words, it learns). Then, with that learning,
    a machine assumes whether the newly-given data is yes or no and provides an answer.
    To sum up, machine learning can give an answer by recognizing and sorting out
    patterns from the data provided and then classifying that data into the possible
    appropriate pattern (predicting) when it faces unknown data as a question.

    unconsciously classify data into patterns. For example, if you meet a man/woman

    would compare his/her way of talking, looks, expressions, or gestures to past

    almost impossible for a human to process multi-dimensional data or multiple-patterned
    data, machine learning can process the categorization with almost the same numerical
    formulas. A machine just needs to add a vector or the number of dimensions of
    a matrix. (Internally, when it classifies multi-dimensions, it's not done by a
    classified line or a classified curve but by a hyperplane.)

    learning is the technique of pattern classification and prediction based on input

    it can't. It's obvious that it can't correctly predict based on irrelevant data.

    In this paper, a method called **deep belief nets** (**DBN**) was presented, which
    is an expansion of neural networks, a method of machine learning. DBN was tested
    using the **MNIST** database, the standard database for comparing the precision
    and accuracy of each image recognition method. This database includes 70,000 28

    with precision rates. Moreover, surprisingly, it was the first time SuperVision
    joined this ILSVRC, in other words, image recognition is not their usual field.
    Until SuperVision (deep learning) appeared, the normal approach for the field
    of image recognition was machine learning. And, as mentioned earlier, a feature
    value necessary to use machine learning had to be set or designed by humans. They
    reiterated design features based on human intuition and experiences and fine-tuning
    parameters over and over, which, in the end, contributed to improving precision
    by just 0.1%. The main issue of the research and the competition before deep learning
    evolved was who was able to invent good feature engineering. Therefore, researchers
    must have been surprised when deep learning suddenly showed up out of the blue.

    That event happened in 2012, the same year the world was shocked by SuperVision
    at ILSVRC, when Google announced that a machine could automatically detect a cat
    using YouTube videos as learning data from the deep learning algorithm that Google
    proposed. The details of this algorithm are explained at [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html).
    This algorithm extracted 10 million images from YouTube videos and used them as
    input data. Now, remember, in machine learning, a human has to detect feature
    values from images and process data. On the other hand, in deep learning, original
    images can be used for inputs as they are. This shows that a machine itself comes
    to find features automatically from training data. In this research, a machine
    learned the concept of a cat. (Only this cat story is famous, but the research
    was also done with human images and it went well. A machine learned what a human
    is!) The following image introduced in the research illustrates the characteristics
    of what deep learning thinks a cat is, after being trained using still frames
    from unlabeled YouTube videos:'

    such as what exactly is innovative about deep learning? What special function
    dramatically increased this precision? Surprisingly, actually, there isn't a lot
    of difference for deep learning in algorithms. As mentioned briefly, deep learning
    is an application of neural networks, which is an algorithm of machine learning
    that imitates the structure of a human brain; nevertheless, a device adopted it
    and changed everything. The representatives are **pretraining** and **dropout**
    (with an activation function). These are also keywords for implementation, so
    please remember them.

- en: To begin with, what does the *deep* in deep learning indicate? As you probably
    know, the human brain is a circuit structure, and that structure is really complicated.
    It is made up of an intricate circuit piled up in many layers. On the other hand,
    when the neural network algorithm first appeared its structure was quite simple.
    It was a simplified structure of the human brain and the network only had a few
    layers. Hence, the patterns it could recognize were extremely limited. So, everyone
    wondered "Can we just accumulate networks like the human brain and make its implementation
    complex?" Of course, though this approach had already been tried. Unfortunately,
    as a result, the precision was actually lower than if we had just piled up the
    networks. Indeed, we faced various issues that didn't occur with a simple network.
    Why was this? Well, in a human brain, a signal runs into a different part of the
    circuit depending on what you see. Based on the patterns that differ based on
    which part of the circuit is stimulated, you can distinguish various things.

    of the network by weighting with numbers. This is a great way to do it, but soon
    a problem occurs. If a network is simple, weights are properly allocated from
    the learning data and the network can recognize and classify patterns well. However,
    once a network gets complicated, the linkage becomes too dense and it is difficult
    to make a difference in the weights. In short, it cannot divide into patterns
    properly. Also, in a neural network, the network can make a proper model by adopting
    a mechanism that feeds back errors that occurred during training to the whole
    network. Again, if the network is simple the feedback can be reflected properly,
    but if the network has many layers a problem occurs in which the error disappears
    before it's reflected to the whole network—just imagine if that error was stretched
    out and diluted.

    structure ended in disappointing failure. The concept of the algorithm itself
    was splendid but it couldn't be called a good algorithm by any standards; that
    was the world's understanding. While deep learning succeeded in making a network
    multi-layered, that is, making a network "deep," the key to success was to make
    each layer learn in stages. The previous algorithm treated the whole multi-layered
    network as one gigantic neural network and made it learn as one, which caused
    the problems mentioned earlier.

- en: Hence, deep learning took the approach of making each layer learn in advance.
    This is literally known as pretraining. In pretraining, learning starts from the
    lower-dimension layer in order. Then, the data that is learned in the lower layer
    is treated as input data for the next layer. This way, machines become able to
    take a step by learning a feature of a low layer at the low-grade layer and gradually
    learning a feature of a higher grade. For example, when learning what a cat is,
    the first layer is an outline, the next layer is the shape of its eyes and nose,
    the next layer is a picture of a face, the next layers is the detail of a face,
    and so on. Similarly, it can be said that humans take the same learning steps
    as they catch the whole picture first and see the detailed features later. As
    each layer learns in stages, the feedback for an error of learning can also be
    done properly in each layer. This leads to an improvement in precision. There
    is also a device for each respective approach to each layer's learning, but this
    will be introduced later on.

- en: We have also addressed the fact that the network became too dense. The method
    that prevents this density problem is called the **dropout**. Networks with the
    dropout learn by cutting some linkages randomly within the units of networks.
    The dropout physically makes the network sparse. Which linkage is cut is random,
    so a different network is formed at each learning step. Just by looking, you might
    doubt that this will work, but it greatly contributes to improving the precision
    and as a result it increases the robustness of the network. The circuit of the
    human brain also has different places in which to react or not depending on the
    subject it sees. The dropout seems to be able to successfully imitate this mechanism.
    By embedding the dropout in the algorithm, the adjustment of the network weight
    was done well.

    learning has a demerit too. As is shown in the name "deep learning," the learning
    in this method is very deep. This means the steps to complete the learning take
    a long time. The amount of calculation in this process tends to be enormous. In
    fact, the previously mentioned learning of the recognition of a cat by Google
    took three days to be processed with 1,000 computers. Conversely, although the
    idea of deep learning itself could be conceived using past techniques, it couldn't
    be implemented. The method wouldn't appear if you couldn't easily use a machine
    that has a large-scale processing capacity with massive data.

    human-like knowledge. Nobody knows what kind of innovation will happen in the
    future. Yet we can predict to what extent a computer's performance will be improved
    in the future. To predict this, Moore's law is used. The performance of an integrated
    circuit that supports the progress of a computer is indicated by the loaded number
    of transistors. Moore's law shows the number, and the number of transistors is
    said to double every one and a half years. In fact, the number of transistors
    in the CPU of a computer has been increasing following Moore's law. Compared to
    the world's first micro-processor, the Intel® 4004 processor, which had 1x103
    (one thousand) transistors, the recent 2015 version, the 5th Generation Intel®
    Core™ Processor, has 1x109 (one billion)! If this technique keeps improving at
    this pace, the number of transistors will exceed ten billion, which is more than
    the number of cells in the human cerebrum.

    produce self-recursive intelligence. In other words, in about 30 years, AI will
    be ready. What will the world be like then…

    now in the third boom. Searching and traversing algorithms were developed in the
    first boom, such as DFS and BFS. Then, the study focused on how knowledge could

    built up much useful knowledge of AI fields. The third boom spread out with machine
    learning algorithms in the beginning with those of pattern recognition and classification
    based on probabilistic statistical models. With machine learning, we've made great
    progress in various fields, but this is not enough to realize true AI because
    we need to tell a machine what the features of objects to be classified are. The
    technique required for machine learning is called feature engineering. Then, deep
    learning came out, based on one machine learning algorithm - namely, neural networks.
    A machine can automatically learn what the features of objects are with deep learning,
    and thus deep learning is recognized as a very innovative technique. Studies of
    deep learning are becoming more and more active, and every day new technologies
    are invented. Some of the latest technologies are introduced in the last chapter
    of this book, [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. What's Next?"), *What's Next?*,
