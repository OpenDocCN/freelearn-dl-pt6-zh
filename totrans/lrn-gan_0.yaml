- en: The concepts and models (reviewed in this book) will help to build and effectively
    take deep networks from the arena of supervised task such as image classification,
    toward the unsupervised learning with creative power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the basic generative network concepts, you'll learn to generate realistic
    images from unlabeled data, to synthesize images from textual descriptions, and
    to discover relationships across various domains for style transfer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Deep Learning"), *Introduction
    to Deep Learning*, speaks all about refreshing general concepts and terminology
    associated with deep learning in a simple way without too much math and equations.
    Also, it will show how deep learning network has evolved throughout the years
    and how they are making an inroad in the unsupervised domain with the emergence
    of generative models.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Unsupervised Learning with GAN"), *Unsupervised
    Learning with GAN*, shows how Generative Adversarial Networks work and speaks
    about the building blocks of GANs. It will show how deep learning networks can
    be used on semi-supervised domains, and how you can apply them to image generation
    and creativity. GANs are hard to train. This chapter looks at some techniques
    to improve the training/learning process.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Transfer Image Style Across Various Domains"),
    *Transfer Image Style Across Various Domains,* speaks about being very creative
    with simple but powerful CGAN and CycleGAN models. It explains the use of Conditional
    GAN to create images based on certain characteristics or conditions. This chapter
    also discusses how to overcome model collapse problems by stabilizing your network
    training using BEGAN. And finally, it covers transferring styles across different
    domains (apple to orange; horse to zebra) using CycleGAN.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Building Realistic Images from Your Text"),
    *Building Realistic Images from Your Text*, presents the latest approach of stacking
    Generative Adversarial Networks into multiple stages to decompose the problem
    of text to image synthesis into two more manageable subproblems with StackGAN.
    The chapter also shows how DiscoGAN successfully transfers styles across multiple
    domains to generate output images of handbags from the given input of shoe images
    or to perform gender transformations of celebrity images.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Using Various Generative Models to Generate
    Images"), *Using Various Generative Models to Generate Images*, introduces the
    concept of a pretrained model and discusses techniques for running deep learning
    and generative models over large distributed systems using Apache Spark. We will
    then enhance the resolution of low quality images using pretrained models with
    GAN. And finally, we will learn other varieties of generative models such as DeepDream
    and VAE for image generation and styling.'

    *Taking Machine Learning to Production*, describes various approaches to deploying
    machine learning and deep learning-based intelligent applications to production
    both on data center and the cloud using microservice-based containerized or serverless
    techniques.'
