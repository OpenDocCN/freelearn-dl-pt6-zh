- en: Dear reader, thank you for choosing this book to pursue your interest in natural
    language processing. This book will give you a practical viewpoint to understand
    and implement NLP solutions from scratch. We will take you on a journey that will
    start with accessing inbuilt data sources and creating your own sources. And then
    you will be writing complex NLP solutions that will involve text normalization,
    preprocessing, POS tagging, parsing, and much more.

    We will also learn to extract raw text from web sources. And finally we will normalize
    raw text from these heterogeneous sources and organize it in corpus.'

    POS tagging forms the basis of any further syntactic analyses, and grammars can
    be formed and deformed using POS tags and chunks. We will learn to use and write
    our own POS taggers and grammars.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To perform the recipes of this book successfully, you will need Python 3.x or
    higher running on any Windows- or Unix-based operating system with a processor
    of 2.0 GHz or higher and minimum 4 GB RAM. As far as the IDE for Python development
    are concerned, there are many available in the market but my personal favorite
    is PyCharm community edition. It's free, it's open source, and it's developed
    by Jetbrains. That means support is excellent, advancement and fixes are distributed
    at a steady pace, and familiarity with IntelliJ keeps the learning curve pretty
    flat.
