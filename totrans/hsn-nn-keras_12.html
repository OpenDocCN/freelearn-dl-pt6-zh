<p>In the last chapter, we submerged ourselves in the world of autoencoding neural networks. We saw how these models can be used to estimate parameterized functions capable of reconstructing given inputs with respect to target outputs. While at prima facie this may seem trivial, we now know that this manner of self-supervised encoding has several theoretical and practical implications.</p>
<p><span>In fact, from a <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) perspective, the ability to approximate a connected set of points in a higher dimensional space on to a lower dimensional space (that is, manifold learning) has several advantages, ranging from higher data storage efficiency to more efficient memory consumption. Practically speaking, this allows us to discover ideal coding schemes for different types of data, or to perform dimensionality reduction thereupon, for use cases such asÂ <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> (<strong>PCA</strong>) or even information retrieval. The task of searching for specific information using similar queries, for example, can be largely augmented by learning useful representations from a set of data, stored in a lower dimensional space. Moreover, the learned representations can even be used thereafter as feature detectors to classify new, incoming data. This sort of application may allow us to construct powerful databases capable of high-level inference and reasoning, when presented with a query. Derivative implementations may include legal databases used by lawyers to efficiently search for precedents by similarity to the current case, or medical systems that allow doctors to efficiently diagnose patients based on the noisy data available per patient. These latent variable models allow researchers and businesses alike to address various use cases, ranging from sequence-to-sequence machine translation, to attributing complex intents to customer reviews. Essentially, with generative models, we attempt to answer this question: <em>How likely are these features (</em>x<em>) present in an instance of data, given that it belongs to a certain class (</em>y<em>)</em>? This is very different than asking this question: <em>How likely is this instance part of a class (</em>y<em>), given the features (</em>x<em>) present?</em></span>, <span>as we would for supervised learning tasks. To better understand this reversal of roles, we will further explore the idea behind latent variable modeling, introduced in the previous chapter.</span></p>
<p><span>In this chapter, we will see how we can take the concept of latent variables a step further. Instead of simply learning a parameterized function, which maps inputs to outputs, we can use neural networks to learn a function that represents the probability distribution over the latent space. We can then sample from such a probability distribution to generate novel, synthetic instances of the input data. This is the core theoretical foundation behind generative modeling, as we are about to discover.</span></p>

<p>While our autoencoding use cases in the last chapter were limited to image reconstruction and denoising, these use cases are quite distinct from the one we are about to address in this chapter. So far, we made our autoencoders reconstruct some given inputs, by learning an arbitrary mapping function. In this chapter, we want to understand how to train a model to create new instances of some content, instead of simply replicating its inputs. In other words, what if we asked a neural network to truly be creative and generate content just like human beings do?. Can this even be achieved? The canonical answer common in the realm of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is yes, but it is complicated. In the search for a more detailed answer, we arrive at the topic of this chapter: generative networks.</p>
<p>While a plethora of generative networks exist, ranging from the variations of the <strong>Deep Boltzman Machine</strong> to <strong>Deep Belief Networks</strong>, most of them have fallen out of fashion, given their restrictive applicability and the appearance of more computationally efficient methods. A few, however, continue to remain in the spotlight, due to their eerie ability to generate synthetic content, such as faces that have never existed, movie reviews and news articles that were never written, or videos that were never actually filmed! To better understand the mechanics behind this wizardry, let's dedicate a few lines to the notion of latent spaces, to better understand how these models transform their learned representations to create something seemingly new.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Recall from the previous chapter that a <strong>latent space</strong> is nothing but a compressed representation of the input data in a lower dimensional space. It essentially includes features that are crucial to the identification of the original input. To better understand this notion, it is helpful to try to mentally visualize what type of information may be encoded by the latent space. A useful analogy can be to think of how we ourselves create content, with our imagination. Suppose you were asked to create an imaginary animal. What information would you be relying on to create this creature? You will sample features from animals you have previously seen, features such as their color, or whether they are bi-pedal, quadri-pedal, a mammal or reptile, land-or sea-dwelling, and so on. As it turns out, we ourselves develop latent models of the world, as we navigate through it. When we attempt to imagine a new instance of a class, we are actually sampling some latent variable models, learned throughout the course of our existence.</p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Think about it. Throughout our lives, we came across countless animals of different colors, sizes, and morphologies. We reduce these rich representations to more manageable dimensions all the time. For example, we all know what a lion looks like, because we have mentally encoded properties (or latent variables) that represent a lion (such as their four legs, tail, furry coat, color, and so on). These learned properties are a testament to how we store information in lower dimensions, to create functional models of the world around us. We hypothesize that such information is stored in lower dimensions, as most of us, for example, are not able to perfectly recreate the image of a lion on paper. Some may not even come close to it, as is the case for the author of this work. Yet, we are all instantly and collectively able to agree on what the general morphology of a lion would be, just by mentioning the word <em>lion</em>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">This little thought experiment demonstrates the sheer power of latent variable models, in creating functional representations of the world. Our brain would very likely consume a lot more than the meagre 12 watts of energy, were it not constantly downsampling the information received from our sensory inputs to create manageable and realistic models of the world. Thus, using latent variable models essentially allows us to query reduced representation (or properties) of the input, which may in turn be recombined with other representations to generate a seemingly novel output (for example: unicorn = body and face from horse + horn from rhino/narwhal).</p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText"><span>Similarly, neural networks may also transform samples from a learned latent space, to generate novel content. One way of achieving this is by identifying concept vectors, embedded in the learned latent space. The idea here is quite simple. Suppose we are to sample a face</span> (<span><em>f</em>) from a latent space representing faces. Then, another point, (<em>f + c</em>), can be thought of as the embedded representation of the same face, along with some modification (that is, the presence of a smile, or glasses, or facial hair, on top of the original face). These concept vectors essentially encode various axes of disparities from the input data, and can then be used to alter interesting properties of the input images. In other words, we can probe the latent space for vectors that elude to a concept present within the input data. After identifying such vectors, we can then modify them to change properties of the input data. A smile vector, for example, can be learned and used to modify the degree to which a person is smiling, in a given image. Similarly, a gender vector could be used to modify the appearance of a person, to look more female, than male, or vice versa. Now that we have a better idea of what kind of information may be queried from latent spaces, and subsequently be modified to generate new content, we can continue on our exploratory journey.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span>So, let's try to understand the core mechanics of generative networks and how such approaches differ from the ones we already know. In our quest thus far, most of the networks we have implemented are for the purpose of executing a deterministic transformation of some inputs, in order to get to some sort of outputs. It was not until we explored the topic of reinforcement learning (<a href="f011d850-2ed4-4506-8fc9-4930e6a85d85.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks</em></span>) <span>that we learned the benefits of introducing a degree of <strong>stochasticity</strong> (that is, randomness) to our modeling efforts. This is a core notion that we will be further exploring as we familiarize ourselves with the manner in which generative networks function. As we mentioned earlier, the central idea behind generative networks is to use a deep neural network to learn the probability distribution of variables over a reduced latent space. Then, the latent space can be sampled and transformed in a quasi-random manner, to generate some outputs (<em>y</em>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">As you may notice, this is quite different than the approach we employed in the previous chapter. With autoencoders, we simply estimated an arbitrary function, mapping inputs (<em>x</em>) to a compressed latent space using an encoder, from which we reconstructed outputs (<em>y</em>) using a decoder. In the case of generative networks, we instead learn a latent variable model for our input data (<em>x</em>). Then, we can transform samples from the latent space to get to our generated output. Neat, don't you think? Yet, before we further explore how this concept is operationalized, let's briefly go over the role of randomness in relation to generating creative content.</p>

            <article>
                
<p><span>Recall that we introduced an element of randomness in the deep reinforcement learning algorithm by using the <strong>epsilon greedy selection</strong> strategy, which basically allowed our network to not rely too much on the same actions and allowed it to explore new actions to solve the given environment. Introducing this randomness, in a sense, brought creativity to the process, as our network was able to systematically create novel state-action pairs without relying on what it had learned previously learned. Do note, however, that labeling the consequence of introducing randomness in a system as creativity may be the result of some anthropomorphism on our part. In fact, the true processes that gave birth to creativity in humans (our go-to benchmark) are still vastly elusive and poorly understood by the scientific community at large. On the other hand, this link between randomness and creativity itself is a long recognized one, especially in the realm of AI. As early as 1956, AI researchers have been interested in transcending the seemingly deterministic limitations of machines. Back then, the prominence of rule-based systems made it seem as though notions such as creativity could only be observed in advanced biological organisms. Despite this widespread belief, one of the paramount documents that shaped AI history (arguably for the following century to come), the <em>Dartmouth Summer Research Project Proposal</em> (1956), specifically mentioned the role of controlled randomness in AI systems, and its link to generating creative content. While we encourage you to read the entire document, we present an extract from it that is relevant to the point at hand:</span></p>
<div class="packt_quote">"A fairly attractive and yet clearly incomplete conjecture is that the difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of some randomness. The randomness must be guided by intuition to be efficient. In other words, the educated guess or the hunch include controlled randomness in otherwise orderly thinking."</div>

<p>Over the years, we developed methods that operationalize this notion of injecting some controlled randomness, which in a sense are guided by the intuition of the inputs. When we speak of generative models, we essentially wish to implement a mechanism that allows controlled and quasi-randomized transformations of our input, to generate something new, yet still plausibly resembling the original input.</p>
<p>Let's consider for a moment how this can be achieved. We wish to train a neural network to use some input variables (<em>x</em>) to generate some output variables (<em>y</em>), from a latent space produced by a model. An easy way to solve this is to simply add an element of randomness as input to our generator network, defined here by the variable (<em>z</em>). The value of <em>z</em> may be sampled from some probability distribution (a Gaussian distribution, for example) and fed to a neural network along with the inputs. Hence, this network will actually be estimating the function <em>f(x, z)</em> and not simply <em>f(x)</em>. Naturally, to an independent observer who is not able to measure the value of <em>z</em>, this function will seem stochastic, yet this will not be the case in reality.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">To further elaborate, suppose we had to draw some samples (<em>y</em>) from a probability distribution of variables from a latent space, with a mean of (Î¼) and a variance of (Ï<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">2</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoFootnoteText"><span><strong>Sampling operation</strong>:</span> <em>y Ì´ N(Î¼ , Ï<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">2</span>)</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Since we use a sampling process to draw from this distribution, each individual sample may change every time the process is queried. We can't exactly differentiate the generated sample (<em>y</em>) with respect to the distribution parameters (Î¼ and Ï<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">2</span>), since we are dealing with a sampling operation, and not a function. So, how exactly can we backpropagate our model's errors? Well, one solution could be to redefine the sampling process, such as performing a transformation on a random variable (<em>z</em>), to get to our generated output (<em>y</em>), like so:</p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoFootnoteText"><strong>Sampling equation</strong>: <em>y = Î¼ + Ïz</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">This is a crucial step, as we can now use the backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients of the generated output (<em>y</em>), with respect to the sampling operation itself <em>(Î¼ + Ïz)</em>. What changed? Essentially, we are now treating the sampling operation as a deterministic one that includes the mean(Î¼) and standard deviation (Ï) from our probability distribution, as well as a random variable (<em>z</em>), whose distribution is not related to that of any of the other variables we seek to estimate. We use this method to estimate how changes in our distribution's mean (Î¼) or standard deviation (Ï) affect the generated output (<em>y</em>), given that the sampling operation is reproduced with the same value of <em>z</em>.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Since we can now backpropagate through the sampling operation, we can include this step as part of a larger network. By plugging this into a larger network, we can then redefine the parameters of the earlier sampling operation (Î¼ and Ï), as functions that can be estimated by parts of this larger neural network! More mathematically put, we can redefine the mean and standard deviation of the probability distribution as functions that can be approximated by the parameters of a neural network (for example, <em>Î¼ = f(x ;Î¸)</em> and <em>Ï = g(x; Î¸)</em>, where the term <em>Î¸</em> denotes the learnable parameters of a neural network). We can then use these defined functions to generate an output (<em>y</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li class="MsoFootnoteText"><strong>SampleÂ function</strong>: <em>y = Î¼ + Ïz</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">In this function, <em>Î¼ = f(x ;Î¸)</em> and <em>Ï = g(x; Î¸)</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Now that we know how to sample outputs (<em>y</em>), we can finally train our larger network by differentiating a defined loss function,Â <em>J(y)</em>, with respect to these outputs. Recall that we use the chain rule of differentiation to redefine this process with respect to the intermediate layers, which here represent the parameterized functions (<em>Î¼</em> and <em>Ï</em>). Hence, differentiating this loss function provides us with its derivatives, used to iteratively update the parameters of the network, where the parameters themselves represent a probability distribution.</p>
<p class="MsoFootnoteText">Great! Now we have an overarching theoretical understanding of how these models can generate outputs. This entire process permits us to first estimate, and then sample from, a probability distribution of densely encoded variables, generated by an encoder function. Later in the chapter, we will further explore how different generative networks learn by benchmarking their outputs, and perform weight updates using the backpropagation algorithm.</p>

<p>So, all we are actually doing here is generating an output by transforming a sample taken from the probability distribution representing the encoded latent space. In the last chapter, we saw how to produce such a latent space from some input data using encoding functions. In this chapter, we will see how to learn a continuous latent space (<em>l</em>), then sample from it to generate novel outputs. To do this, we essentially learn a differentiable generator function, <em>g (l ; Î¸<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">(g)</span> ),</em>Â which transforms samples from a continuous latent space (<em>l</em>) to generate an output. Here, this function itself is what is being approximated by the neural network.</p>
<p>The family of generative networks includes both <strong>Variational Autoencoders</strong> (<strong>VAEs</strong>) as well as <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong> (<strong>GANs</strong>). As we mentioned before, there exist many types of generative models, but in this chapter, we will focus on these two variations, given their widespread applicability across various cognitive tasks (such as, computer vision and natural language generation). Notably, VAEs distinguish themselves by coupling the generator network with an approximate inference network, which is simply the encoding architecture we saw in the last chapter. GANs, on the other hand, couple the generator network with a separate discriminator network, which receives samples both from the actual training data and the generated outputs, and is tasked with distinguishing the original image from the computer-generated one. Once the generator is considered fooled, your GAN is considered trained. Essentially, these two different types of generative models employ different methodologies for learning the latent space. This gives each of them unique applicability for different types of use cases. For example, VAEs perform notably well at learning well-structured spaces, where significant variations may be encoded due to the specific composition of the input data (as we will see shortly, using the MNIST dataset). However, VAEs also suffer from blurry reconstructions, the causes of which are not yet properly understood. GANs, on the other hand, do much better at generating realistic content, despite sampling from an unstructured and discontinuous latent space, as we will see later in the chapter.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Now we have a high-level understanding of what generative networks entail, we can focus on a specific type of generative models. One of them is the VAE, proposed by both Kingma and Welling (2013) as well as Rezende, Mohamed, and Wierstra (2014).Â  This model is actually very similar to the autoencoders we saw in the last chapter, but they come with a slight twistâwell, several twists, to be more specific. For one, the latent space being learned is no longer a discrete one, but a continuous one by design! So, what's the big deal? Well, as we explained earlier, we will be sampling from this latent space to generate our outputs. However, sampling from a discrete latent space is problematic. The fact that it is discrete implies that there will be regions in the latent space with discontinuities, meaning that if these regions were to be randomly sampled, the output would look completely unrealistic. On the other hand, learning a continuous latent space allows the model to learn the transitions from one class to another in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, since the latent space being learned is continuous, it becomes possible to identify and manipulate the concept vectors we spoke of earlier, which encodes various axes of variance present in the input data in a meaningful way. At this point, many of you may be wondering how a VAE exactly learns to model a continuous latent space. Well, wonder no more.</p>
<p>Earlier, we saw how we can redefine the sampling process from a latent space, so as to be able to plug it into a larger network to estimate a probability distribution. We did this by breaking the latent space down by using parameterized functions (that is, parts of a neural network) to estimate both the mean (Î¼) and the standard deviation (Ï) of variables in the latent space. In a VAE, its encoder function does exactly this. This is what forces the model to learn a statistical distribution of variables over a continuous latent space. This process permits us to presume that the input image was generated in a probabilistic manner, given that the latent space encodes a probability distribution. Thus, we can use the learned mean and standard deviation parameters to randomly sample from the distribution, and decode it on to the original dimension of the data. The illustration here helps us better understand the workflow of a VAE:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6ac4ab13-f5df-422a-afbd-bdf52e3127ab.png" style="width:35.08em;height:14.33em;" width="1018" height="417"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This process is what allows us to first learn, and then sample from, a continuous latent space, generating plausible outputs. Is this still a bit fuzzy? Well, perhaps a demonstrative example is in order, to help clarify this notion. Let's begin by building a VAE in Keras, and go over both the theory and implementational side of things as we construct our model.</p>

<p>Next, we load the dataset, just as we did in <a href="46e25614-bb5a-4cca-ac3e-b6dfbe29eea5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>,Â <em>Signal ProcessingÂ â Data Analysis with Neural Networks</em>. We also take the liberty to define some variables that can be reused later, when designing our network. Here, we simply define the image size used to define the original dimensions of the images (784 pixels each). We choose an encoding dimension of <kbd>2</kbd> to represent the latent space, and an intermediate dimension of <kbd>256</kbd>. These variables defined here will be later fed to the dense layers of our VAE, defining the number of neurons per layer:</p>
<pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_train</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_train</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x_test</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_test</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mnist</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load_data</span><span class="p">()<br/>image_size = x_train.shape[1]<br/>original_dim=image_size * image_size<br/>latent_dim= 2<br/>intermediate_dim= 256<br/>epochs=50<br/>epsilon_std=1.0<br/><br/>#preprocessing training arrays<br/><br/>x_train=np.reshape(x_train, [-1, original_dim])<br/>x_test=np.reshape(x_test, [-1, original_dim])<br/>x_train=x_train.astype('float 32')/255<br/></span><span class="p">x_test=x_test.astype('float 32')/255</span></pre>
<p>Then, we simply pre-process the images by first flattening them into 2D vectors (of dimension (784) per image). Finally, we normalize the pixel values in these 2D vectors between 0 and 1.</p>

<p class="packt_figure">Next, we will start building the encoding module of our VAE. This part is almost identical to the shallow encoder we built in the last chapter, except that it splits into two separate layers: one estimating the mean and the other estimating the variance over the latent space:</p>
<pre>#Encoder module<br/>input_layer= Input(shape=(original_dim,))<br/>intermediate_layer= Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu', name='Intermediate layer')(input_layer)<br/>z_mean=Dense(latent_dim, name='z-mean')(intermediate_layer)<br/>z_log_var=Dense(latent_dim, name='z_log_var')(intermediate_layer)</pre>
<p>You could optionally add the <kbd>name</kbd> argument while defining a layer, to be able to visualize our model intuitively. If we want, we can actually visualize the network we have built so far, by initializing it already and summarizing it, as shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1179 image-border" src="Images/c20c90de-b96d-4e59-8b8c-96983e8a7344.png" style="width:59.83em;height:24.42em;" width="674" height="275"/></p>
<p>Note how the outputs from the intermediate layer connect to both the mean estimation layer (<kbd>z_mean</kbd>) and the variance estimation layer (<kbd>z_log_var</kbd>), both representing the latent space encoded by the network. Together, these separate layers estimate the probability distribution of variables over the latent space, as described earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>So, now we have a probability distribution being learned by the intermediate layers of our VAE. Next, we need a mechanism to randomly sample from this probability distribution, to generate our outputs. This brings us to the sampling equation.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The idea behind this process here is quite simple. We defined a sample (<em>z</em>) simply by using the learned mean (<kbd>z_mean</kbd>) and variance (<kbd>z_log_variance</kbd>) from our latent space in an equation that may be formulated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><em>z = z_mean + exp(z_log_variance) * epsilon</em></p>
<p>Here, <em>epsilon</em> is simply a random tensor consisting of very small values, ensuring a degree of randomness seeps into the queried sample every time. Since it is a tensor of very small values, it ensures that each decoded image will plausibly resemble the input image.</p>
<p>The samplingÂ function presented here simply takes the values (that is, mean and variance) learned by the encoder network, defines a tensor of small values matching the latent dimensions, and then returns a sample from the probability distribution, using the sampling equation defined previously:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1180 image-border" src="Images/5f70630a-5833-402a-971c-67687476c237.png" style="width:46.58em;height:10.50em;" width="559" height="126"/></p>
<p>Since Keras requires all operations to be nested in layers, we use a custom Lambda layer to nest this sampling function, along with a defined output shape. This layer, defined here as (<kbd>z</kbd>), will be responsible for generating samples from the learned latent space.</p>

<p>Now that we have a mechanism implemented to sample from the latent space, we can proceed to build a decoder capable of mapping this sample to the output space, thereby generating a novel instance of the input data. Recall that just as the encoder funnels the data by narrowing the layer dimensions till the encoded representation is reached, the decoder layers progressively enlarge the representations sampled from the latent space, mapping them back to the original image dimension:</p>
<pre>#Decoder module<br/>decoder_h= Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')<br/>decoder_mean= Dense(original_dim, activation='sigmoid')<br/>h_decoded=decoder_h(z)<br/>x_decoded_mean=decoder_mean(h_decoded)</pre>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Defining a custom variational layer</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>Now that we have constructed both the encoder and the decoder modules of our network, there remains but one implementational matter to divert our attention to before we can start training our VAE. It is quite an important one, as it related to how our network will calculate the loss and update itself to create more realistic generations. This may seem a little odd at first glance. What are we comparing our generations to? It's not as if we have a target representation to compare our model's generations to, so how can we compute our model's errors? Well, the answer is quite simple. We will use two separate <kbd>loss</kbd> functions, each tracking our model's performance over different aspects of the generated image. The first loss function is known as the reconstruction loss, which simply ensures that the decoded output of our model matches the supplied inputs. The second <kbd>loss</kbd> function is described as the regularization loss. This function actually aids our model to not overfit on the training data by simply copying it, thereby learning ideally composed latent spaces from the inputs. Unfortunately, these <kbd>loss</kbd> functions are not implemented in Keras as it is, and hence require a little more technical attention to operationalize.</span></p>
<p>We operationalize these two <kbd>loss</kbd> functions by building a custom variational layer class, this will actually be the final layer of our network, and perform the computation of the two different loss metrics, and use their mean value to compute gradients of the loss with respect to the network parameters:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1181 image-border" src="Images/ca004458-98df-4ad2-9ba8-199b86c8ba14.png" style="width:54.75em;height:23.00em;" width="657" height="276"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the custom layer includes three functions. The first is for initialization. The second function is responsible for computing both losses. It uses the binary cross-entropy metric to compute the reconstruction loss, and the <strong>KullbackâLeibler</strong> (<strong>KL</strong>) divergence formula to compute the regularization loss. The KL-divergence term essentially allows us to compute the relative entropy of the generated output, with respect to the sampled latent space (<em>z</em>). It allows us to iteratively assess the difference in the probability distribution of the outputs different than that of the latent space. The <kbd>vae_loss</kbd> function then returns a combined loss value, which is simply the mean of both these computed metrics.</p>
<p>Finally, the <kbd>call</kbd> function is used to implement the custom layer, by using the built-in <kbd>add_loss</kbd> layer method. This part essentially defines the last layer of our network as the loss layer, thereby using our arbitrarily defined <kbd>loss</kbd> function to generate the loss value, with which backpropagation can be performed.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Next, we define our network's last layer (<em>y</em>) using the custom variational layer class we just implemented, as shown here:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8a5c1a25-1c15-44bf-9249-3e11e7058355.png" width="719" height="29"/></div>
<p><span>Now we are ready to finally compile and train our model! First, we put together the entire model, using the <kbd>Model</kbd> object from the functional API, and passing it the input layer from our encoder module, as well as the last custom loss layer we just defined. Then, we use the usual <kbd>compile</kbd> syntax on our initialized network, equipping it with the <kbd>rmsprop</kbd> optimizer. Do note, however, that since we have a custom loss function, the <kbd>compile</kbd> statement actually does not take any loss metric, where one would usually be present. At this point, we can visualize the entire model, by calling <kbd>.summary()</kbd> on the <kbd>vae</kbd> model object, as shown here:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1182 image-border" src="Images/f2705dc9-4a46-4bdc-895e-f227bb7cc57c.png" style="width:54.33em;height:36.58em;" width="652" height="439"/></div>
<p>As you can see, this architecture takes in the input images and funnels them down to two distinct encoded representations:Â <kbd>z_mean</kbd> and <kbd>z_log_var</kbd> (that is, a learned mean and variance over the latent space). This probability distribution is then sampled using the added Lambda layer to produce a point in the latent space. This point is then decoded by dense layers (<kbd>dense_5</kbd> and <kbd>dense_6</kbd>), before a loss can be computed by our final custom-built loss layer. Now you have seen everything.</p>

<p>Now comes the time to actually train our network. There is nothing out of the ordinary here, except for the fact that we do not have to specify a target variable (that is, <kbd>y_train</kbd>). This is simply because the target is normally used to compute the loss metrics, which is now being computed by our final custom layer. You may also notice that the loss values displayed during training are quite large, compared to previous implementations. Don't be alarmed at their magnitude, as this is simply the result of the manner in which loss is computed for this architecture:</p>

<p>This model is trained for 50 epochs, at the end of which we were able to attain a validation loss of <kbd>151.71</kbd> and a training loss of <kbd>149.39</kbd>. Before we generate some novel-looking handwritten digits, let's try visualizing the latent space that our model was able to learn.</p>

<p>Since we have a two-dimensional latent space, we can simply plot out the representations as a 2D manifold where encoded instances of each digit class may be visualized with respect to their proximity to other instances. This allows us to inspect the continuous latent space that we spoke of before and see how the network relates to different features in the 10-digit classes (0 to 9) to each other. To do this, we revisit the encoding module from our VAE, which can now be used to produce a compressed latent space from some given data. Thus, we use the encoder module to make predictions on the test set, thereby encoding these images the latent space. Finally, we can use a scatterplot from Matplotlib to plot out the latent representation. Do note that each individual point represents an encoded instance from the test set. The colors denote the different digit classes:</p>

<p>Following is the output:</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Note how there is very little discontinuity, or gaps between the different digit classes. Due to this, we can now sample from this encoded representation to produce meaningful digits. Such an operation would not produce meaningful results if the learned latent space were discrete, as was the case for the autoencoders we built in the last chapter. The latent space for these models looks much different, when compared to the one learned by the VAE:</p>

<p>Finally, we can proceed to generate some novel handwritten digits with our VAE. To do this, we simply revisit the decoder part of our VAE (which naturally excludes the loss layer). We will be using it to decode samples from the latent space and generate some handwritten digits that were never actually written by anyone:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/621b3f8b-dfee-404f-84e2-cfc351b28d03.png" width="711" height="115"/></div>
<p>Next, we will display a grid of 15 x 15 digits, each of size 28. To do this, we initialize a matrix of zeros, matching the dimensions of the entire output to be generated. Then, we use the <kbd>ppf</kbd> function from SciPy to transform some linearly placed coordinates to get to the grid values of the latent variables (<kbd>z</kbd>). After this, we enumerate through these grids to obtain a sampled (<kbd>z</kbd>) value. We can now feed this sample to the generator network, which will decode the latent representation, to subsequently reshape the output to the correct format, resulting in the screenshot shown here:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/9034a8e3-8267-4dcd-8800-960886fe9bc5.png" style="width:41.17em;height:43.00em;" width="772" height="806"/></div>
<p>Do note that this grid demonstrates how sampling from a continuous space allows us to literally visualize the underlining factors of variance in the input data. We notice that digits transform into other digits, as we move along the <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> axis. For example, consider moving from the center of the image. Moving to the right can change the digit <strong>8</strong> into a <strong>9</strong>, while moving left will change it into a <strong>6</strong>. Similarly, moving diagonally upward on the right-hand side changes the <strong>8</strong> into a <strong>5</strong> first, and then finally a <strong>1</strong>. These different axes can be thought of as representing the presence of certain properties on a given digit. These properties become accentuated as we progress further and further in the direction of a given axis, moulding the digit into an instance of a specific digit class .</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we saw in our MNIST experiments, the VAE excels at learning a well-composed continuous latent space, from which we may sample and decode outputs. These models are excellent for editing images, or producing psychedelic transitions where images mould into other images. Some businesses have even started experimenting with VAE-based models to allow customers to try out fashion items such as jewelry, sun glasses, or other apparel completely virtually, using the cameras on customers' phones! This is due to the fact that VAEs are uniquely suited to learning and editing concept vectors, as we discussed earlier. For instance, if you want to generate a new sample halfway between a 1 and a 0, we can simply compute the difference between their mean vectors from the latent space and add half the difference to the original before decoding it. This will produce a 6, as we can see in the previous screenshot. The same concept applies to a VAE trained on images of faces (using the CelebFaces dataset, for example), as we can sample a face between two different celebrities, to then create their synthetic sibling. Similarly, if we wanted to generate specific features, such as a mustache on a face, all we would have to do is find a sample of a face with and without a mustache. Then, we can retrieve their respective encoded vectors using the encoding function, and simply save the difference between these two vectors. Now our saved mustache vector is ready to be applied to any image, by adding it to the encoded space of the new image, before decoding it.</p>
<p>Other amusing use cases with VAEs involve swapping faces on a live feed, or adding additional elements for the sake of entertainment. These networks are quite unique in their ability to realistically modify images and produce ones that never originally existed. Naturally, it makes you wonder whether such technologies can be used for less-amusing purposes; misusing these models to misrepresent people or situations could potentially lead to some dire outcomes. However, since we can train neural networks to fool humans, we can also train them to help us distinguish such forgeries. This brings us to the next topic of this chapter:Â <strong>GANs</strong>.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The idea behind GANs is much more understandable when compared to other similar models. In essence, we use several neural networks to play a rather elaborate game. Just like in the movie C<em>atch-me-if-you-can</em>. For those who are not familiar with the plot of this film, we apologize in advance for any missed allusions.</p>
<p>We can think of a GAN as a system of two actors. On one side, we have a Di Caprio-like network that attempts to recreate some Monets and Dalis and ship them off to unsuspecting art dealers. We also have a vigilant Tom Hanks-style network that intercepts these shipments and identifies any forgeries present. As time goes by, both individuals become better at what they do, leading to realistic forgeries on the conman's side, and a keen eye for them on the cop's side. This variation of a commonly used analogy indeed does well at introducing the idea behind these architectures.</p>
<p>A GAN essentially has two parts: a generator and a discriminator. Each of these parts can be thought of as separate neural networks, which work together by checking each other's outputs as the model trains. The generator network is tasked to generate fake data points, by sampling random vectors from a latent space. Then, the discriminator receives these generated data points, along with actual data points, and proceeds to distinguish which one of the data points is real, and which are not (hence the name, <em>discriminator</em>). As our network trains, both the generator and the discriminator get better at creating synthetic data and recognizing synthetic data, respectively:</p>

<p>This architecture was first introduced by Goodfellow and others, 2014, and it has since been popularized by researchers spanning several domains. Their rise to fame was due to their ability to generate synthetic images that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. While we have discussed some of the more amusing and mundane applications that derive from such methods, more complex ones also exist. For instance, while GANs are mostly used for computer vision tasks such as texture editing and image modification, they are increasingly becoming popular in a multitude of academic disciplines, making appearances in more and more research methodologies. Nowadays, you may find GANs being used for medical image synthesis, or even in domains such as particle physics and astrophysics. The same methodology for generating synthetic data can be used to regenerate denoised images from galaxies far, far away or to simulate realistic radiation patterns that would arise from high-energy particle collisions. The true utility of GANs lies in their ability to learn underlining statistical distributions in data, allowing them to generate synthetic instances of the original inputs. Such an approach is especially useful for researchers when collecting real data, but this may be prohibitively expensive, or physically impossible. Furthermore, the utility of GANs is not limited to the domain of computer vision. Other applications have included using variations of these networks to generate fine-grained images from natural language data, such as a sentence describing some scenery:</p>

<p>These use cases all show how GANs permit us to address novel tasks, with creative as well as practical implications. Yet, these architectures are not all fun and games. They are notoriously difficult to train, and those who have ventured deep into these waters describe it as more of an art than a science.</p>

<p><span>So, let's try to better understand how the different parts of the GAN work together to generate synthetic data. Consider the parameterized function (</span><em>G</em><span>) (you know, the kind we usually approximate using a neural network). This will be our generator, which samples its input vectors (</span><em>z</em><span>) from some latent probability distribution, and transforms them into synthetic images. Our discriminator network (</span><em>D</em><span>), will then be presented with some synthetic images produced by our generator, mixed among real images, and attempt to classify real from forgery. Hence, our discriminator network is simply a binary classifier, equipped with something like a sigmoid activation function. Ideally, we want the discriminator to output high values when presented with real images, and low values when presented with generated fakes. Conversely, we want our generator network to try to fool the discriminator network, by making it output high values for the generated fakes as well. These concepts bring us to the mathematical formulation of training a GAN, which is essentially a battle between two neural networks (</span><em>D</em> <span>and</span> <em>G</em><span>), each trying to one-up the other:</span></p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4a9a9cd4-0a21-4a4c-ba43-1bb3ed86478e.png" style="width:33.08em;height:6.00em;" width="784" height="144"/></div>
<p><span>In the given formulation, the first term actually denotes the entropy relating to a data point (<em>x</em>) from the real distribution, presented to the discriminator. The goal of the discriminator is to try maximize this term to 1, as it wishes to correctly identify real images. Furthermore, the second term in the formulation denotes the entropy relating to a randomly sampled point, transformed into a synthetic image by the generator,Â <em>G(z)</em>, presented to the discriminator,Â <em>D(G(z))</em>. The discriminator wants none of this, and hence it seeks to maximize the log probability of the data point being fake (that is, the second term), to 0. Hence, we can state that the discriminator is trying to maximize the entire <em>VÂ </em>function. The generator function, on the other hand, will be doing quite the contrary. The generator's goal is to try to minimize the first term and maximize the second term so that the discriminator is not able to tell real from fake. And so begins the laborious game between cop and thief.</span></p>

<p>Interestingly, since both networks take turns to optimize their own metric, the GAN has a dynamic loss landscape. This is different than all other examples we have seen in this book, where the loss hyperplane would remain the same, as we descended it by backpropagating our model errors, converging to more ideal parameters. Here, however, since both networks get a go at optimizing their parameters, each step down the hyperplane changes the landscape a tiny bit, until an equilibrium is reached between the two optimization constraints. As with many things in life, this equilibrium is not easily achieved, and it requires a lot of attention and effort. In the case of GANs, attention to aspects such as layer weight initialization, usage of <kbd>LeakyRelu</kbd> and <kbd>tanh</kbd> instead of <strong>Rectified Linear Unit</strong>Â (<strong>ReLU</strong>)Â and sigmoid activation functions, implementing batch normalization and dropout layers, and so on, are but a few among the vast array of considerations that may improve your GAN's ability to attain equilibrium. Yet, there is no better way of familiarizing ourselves with these issues than to get our hands on some code and actually implement an instance of these fascinating architectures.</p>

<p>For this exercise, suppose you were part of a research team working for a large automobile manufacturer. Your boss wants you to come up with a way to generate synthetic designs for cars, to systematically inspire the design team. You have heard all the hype about GANs and have decided to investigate whether they can be used for the task at hand. To do this, you want to first do a proof of concept, so you quickly get a hold of some low-resolution pictures of cars and design a basic GAN in Keras to see whether the network is at least able to recreate the general morphology of cars. Once you can establish this, you can convince your manager to invest in a few <em>Titan x GUPs</em> for the office, get some higher-resolution data, and develop some more complex architectures. So, let's start by implementing this proof of concept by first getting our hands on some pictures of cars. For this demonstrative use case, we use the good old CIFAR-10 dataset, and restrict ourselves to the commercial automobile category. We start our implementation exercise by importing some libraries, as shown here:</p>

<p>We proceed by simply loading up the data through Keras, and selecting only car images (index = 1). Then, we check the shape of our training and test arrays. We see that there are 5,000 training images and 1,000 test images:</p>

<p>Next, we simply normalize our pixel values. Unlike previous attempts, however, this time, we normalize the pixel values between -1 and 1 (instead of between 0 and 1). This is due to the fact that we will be using a <kbd>tanh</kbd> activation function for the generator network. This specific activation function outputs values between -1 and 1; hence, normalizing the data in a similar manner makes the learning process smoother:</p>

<p>We encourage you to try different normalization strategies to explore how this affects learning as the network trains. Now we have all the components in place to start constructing the GAN architecture.</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part. We will be implementing a <strong>Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network</strong> (<strong>DCGAN</strong>). We start with the first part of the DCGAN: the generator network. The generator network will essentially learn to recreate realistic car images, by transforming a sample from some normal probability distribution, representing a latent space.</p>
<p><span>We will again use the functional API to defile our model, nesting it in a function with three different arguments. The first argument, <kbd>latent_dim</kbd>, refers to the dimension of the input data randomly sampled from a normal distribution. The <kbd>leaky_alpha</kbd> argument simply refers to the alpha parameter provided to the <kbd>LeakyRelu</kbd> activation function used throughout the network. Finally, the argument <kbd>init_stddev</kbd> simply refers to the standard deviation with which to initialize the random weights of the network, used to define the <kbd>kernel_initializer</kbd> argument, when constructing a layer:</span></p>

<p>Note the number of considerations taken while designing this model here. For instance, the <kbd>LeakyReLU</kbd> activation function is chosen in penultimate layers due to their ability to relax the sparsity constraint on outputs, when compared to the ReLU. This is simply due to the fact that <kbd>LeakyReLU</kbd> tolerates some small negative gradient values as well, whereas the ReLU simply squishes all negative values to zero. Gradient sparsity is usually considered a desirable property when training neural networks, yet this does not hold true for GANs. This is the same reason why max-pooling operations are not very popular in DCGANs, since this downsampling operation often produces sparse representations. Instead, we will be using the stride convolutions with the Conv2D transpose layer, for our downsampling needs. We also implemented batch normalization layers (with a moment for moving the mean and variance set to 0.8), as we noticed that this had a considerable effect on improving the quality of the generated images. You will also notice that the size of the convolutional kernels is set to be divisible by the stride, for each convolutional layer. This has been also noted to improve generated images, while reducing discrepancy between areas of the generated image, since the convolutional kernel is allowed to equally sample all regions. Finally, the last layer of the network is equipped with a <kbd>tanh</kbd> activation function, as this has consistently shown to produce better results with the GAN architecture. The next screenshot depicts the entire generator module of our GAN, which will produce the 32 x 32 x 3 synthetic images of cars, subsequently used to try fool the discriminator module:</p>

<p>Next, we continue our journey designing the discriminator module, which will be responsible for telling the real images from the fake ones supplied by the generator module we just designed. The concept behind the architecture is quite similar to that of the generator, with some key differences. The discriminator network receives images of a 32 x 32 x 3 <span>dimension</span>, which it then transforms into various representations as information propagates through deeper layers, until the dense classification layer is reached, equipped with one neuron and a sigmoid activation function. It has one neuron, since we are dealing with the binary classification task of distinguishing fake from real. The <kbd>sigmoid</kbd> function ensures a probabilistic output between 0 and 1, indicating how fake or real the network thinks a given image may be. Do also note the inclusion of the dropout layer before the dense classifier layer, introduced for the sake of robustness and generalizability:</p>

<p>Next, we weave together the two modules using this function shown here. As arguments, it takes the size of the latent samples for the generator, which will be transformed by the generator network to produce synthetic images. It also accepts a learning rate and a decay rate for both the generator and discriminator networks. Finally, the last two arguments denote the alpha value for the <kbd>LeakyReLU</kbd> activation function used, as well as a standard deviation value for the random initialization of network weights:</p>

<p>We simply ensure that no previous Keras session is running by calling <kbd>.clear_session()</kbd> on the imported backend object, <kbd>K</kbd>. Then, we can define the generator and discriminator networks by calling their respective functions that we designed earlier and supplying them with the appropriate arguments. Note that the discriminator is compiled, while the generator is not.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Do note that the functions are designed in a way that encourage fast experimentation by changing different model hyperparameters using the arguments.</div>
<p>Finally, after compiling the discriminator network with a binary cross-entropy loss function, we merge the two separate networks together. We do this using the sequential API, which allows you to merge two fully connected models together with much ease. Then, we can compile the entire GAN, again using the same loss and optimizer, yet with a different learning rate. We chose the <kbd>Adam</kbd> optimizer in our experiments, with a learning rate of 0.0001 for our GAN, and 0.001 for the discriminator network, which happened to work well for the task at hand.</p>

<p>Next, we will define some helper functions that will aid us in the training process. The first among them simply makes a sample of latent variables from a normal probability distribution. Next, we have the <kbd>make_trainable()</kbd> function, which helps us train the discriminator and generator networks in turn. In other words, it allows us to freeze the layer weights of one module (the discriminator or the generator), while the other one is trained. The trainable argument for this function is just a Boolean variable (true or false). Finally, the <kbd>make_labels()</kbd> function simply returns labels to train the discriminator module. These labels are binary, where <kbd>1</kbd> stands for real, and <kbd>0</kbd> for fake:</p>

<p>The next two helper functions allow us to visualize our losses at the end of the training session, as well as plot an image out at the end of each epoch, to visually assess how the network is doing. Since the loss landscape is dynamically changing, the loss values have much less meaning. As is often the case with generative networks, evaluation of their output is mostly left to visual inspection by human observers. Hence, it is important that we are able to visually inspect the model's performance during the training session:</p>

<p>The first function simply accepts a list of loss values for the discriminator and the generator network over the training session, to transpose and plot them out over the epochs. The second function allows us to visualize a grid of generated images at the end of each epoch.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>You are already familiar with most of the arguments of the training function. The first four arguments simply refer to the learning rate and decay rate used for the generator and the discriminator networks, respectively. Similarly, the <kbd>leaky_alpha</kbd> parameter is the negative slope coefficient we implemented for our <kbd>LeakyReLU</kbd> activation function, used in both networks. The smooth argument that follows represents the implementation of one-sided label smoothing, as proposed by Goodfellow and others, 2016. The idea behind this is to replace the real (1) target values for the discriminator module with smoothed values, such as 0.9, as this has shown to reduce the susceptibility of neural networks to fail at adversarial examples:</span></p>

<p><span>Next, we have four more parameters, which are quite simple to follow. The first among them is <kbd>sample_size</kbd>, referring to the size of the sample taken from the latent space. Next, we have the number of training epochs and <kbd>batch_size</kbd> in which to perform weight updates. Finally, we have the <kbd>eval_size</kbd>Â argument, which refers to the number of generated images to evaluate at the end of each training epoch.</span></p>

<p>Next, we define the label arrays to be used for the training and evaluation images, by calling the <kbd>make_labels()</kbd> function, and using the appropriate batch dimension. This will return us arrays with the labels 1Â and 0 for each instance of the training and evaluation image:</p>

<p>Following this, we initialize the GAN network by calling the <kbd>make_DCGAN()</kbd> function we defined earlier and providing it with the appropriate arguments:</p>

<p>Thereafter, we define a list to collect the loss values for each network during training. To train this network, we will actually use the <kbd>.train_on_batch()</kbd> method, which allows us to selectively manipulate the training process, as is required for our use case. Essentially, we will implement a double <kbd>for</kbd> loop:</p>
<pre>    <span class="n">losses</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">epoch_indx</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">epochs</span><span class="p">):</span>

            <span class="c1"># latent samples and the generated images</span>

            <span class="c1"># train the discriminator to detect real and fake images</span>
            <span class="n">make_trainable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">discriminator</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="n">discriminator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">train_on_batch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_batch_real</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_train_real</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">smooth</span><span class="p">))</span>

<p>Hence, for each batch in each epoch, we will first train the discriminator, and then the generator, on the given batch of data. We begin by taking the first batch of real training images, as well as sampling a batch of latent variables from a normal distribution. Then, we use the generator module to make a prediction on the latent sample, essentially generating a synthetic image of a car.</p>
<p>Following this, we allow the discriminator to be trained on both batches (that is, of real and generated images), using the <kbd>make_trainable()</kbd> function. This is where the discrimator is given the opportunity to learn to tell real from fake.</p>

<p>After this, we freeze the layers of the discriminator, again using the <kbd>make_trainable()</kbd> function, this time to train the rest of the network only. Now it is the generator's turn to try beat the discriminator, by generating a realistic image:</p>

<p>Next, we exit the <kbd>nested</kbd> loop to perform some actions at the end of each epoch. We randomly sample some real images as well as latent variables, and then generate some fake images to plot out. Do note that we used the <kbd>.test_on_batch()</kbd> method to obtain the loss values of the discriminator and the GAN and append them to our loss list. At the end of each epoch, we print out the discriminator and generator loss and plot out a grid of 16 samples. Now all that is left is to call this function:</p>

<p>We finally initiate the training session with the respective arguments. You will notice the tqdm Â module displaying a percentage bar indicating the number of processed batches per epoch. At the end of the epoch, you will be able to visualize a 4 x 4 grid (shown next) of samples generated from the GAN network. And there you have it, now you know how to implement a GAN in Keras. On a side note, it can be very beneficial to have <kbd>tensorflow-gpu</kbd> along with CUDA set up, if you're running the code on a local machine with access to a GPU. We ran this code for 200 epochs, yet it would not be uncommon to let it run for thousands of epochs, given the resources and time. Ideally, the longer the two networks battle, the better the results should get. Yet, this may not always be the case, and hence, such attempts may also require careful monitoring of the loss values:</p>

<p>As you can see next, the loss values on the test set change at quite an unstable rate. We expect different optimizers to exhibit smother or rougher loss curves, and we encourage you to test these assumptions using different loss functions (RMSProp is an excellent one to start off with, for example). While looking at the plotted losses is not too intuitive, visualizing the generated images across the epochs allows some meaningful evaluation of this exercise:</p>

<p>In the following, we present eight snapshots of the 16 x 16 grids of generated samples, spread across different times during the training session. While the images themselves are pretty small, they undeniably resemble the morphology of cars toward the end of the training session:</p>

<p>And there you have it. As you can see, the GAN becomes quite good at generating realistic car images after a while, as it gets better and better at fooling the discriminator. Towards the final epochs, it is even hard for the human eye to distinguish real from fake, at least at first glance. Furthermore, we achieved this with a relatively simple and straightforward implementation. This feat seems even more remarkable when we consider the fact that the generator network never actually sees a single real image. Recall that it is simply sampling from a random probability distribution, and uses only the feedback from the discriminator to better its own output! As we saw, the process of training a DCGAN involved a lot of consideration regarding minute detail and choosing specific model constraints and hyperparameters.

<p>In this section of the chapter, we implemented a specific type of GAN (that is, the DCGAN) for a specific use case (image generation). The idea of using two networks in parallel to keep each other in check, however, can be applied to various types of networks, for very different use cases. For example, if you wish to generate synthetic timeseries data, we can implement the same concepts we learned here with recurrent neural networks to design a generative adversarial model! There have been several attempts at this in the research community, with quite successful results. A group of Swedish researchers, for example, used recurrent neural networks in a generative adversarial setup to produce synthetic segments of classical music! Other prominent ideas with GANs involve using attention models (a topic unfortunately not covered by this book) to orient network perception, as well asÂ directing memory access to finer details of an image, for example. Indeed, the fundamental theory we covered in this part of the chapter can be applied in many different realms, using different types of networks so solve more and more complex problems. The core idea remains the same: use two different function approximators, each trying to stay ahead of the other. Next, we present a few links for the interested reader to further familiarize themselves with different GAN-based architectures and their respective uses. We also include a link to a very interesting tool developed by Google and Georgia Tech university, that allows you to visualize the entire training process of a GAN using different types of data distributions and sampling considerations!</p>

<p>In this chapter, we saw how to augment neural networks with randomness in a systematic manner, in order to make them output instances of what we humans deem <em>creative</em>. With VAEs, we saw how parameterized function approximation using neural networks can be used to learn a probability distribution, over a continuous latent space. We then saw how to randomly sample from such a distribution and generate synthetic instances of the original data. In the second part of the chapter, we saw how two networks can be trained in an adversarial manner for a similar task.</p>
<p>The methodology of training GANs is simply a different strategy for learning a latent space compared to their counterpart, the VAE. While GANs have some key benefits for the use case of synthetic image generation, they do have some downsides as well. GANs are notoriously difficult to train and often generate images from unstructured and discontinuous latent spaces, as opposed to VAEs, making GANs harder to use for mining concept vectors. Many other considerations also exist when deciding to choose among these generative networks. The field of generative modeling is continuously expanding, and while we were able to cover some of the fundamental conceptual notions involved, new ideas and techniques surface almost daily, making it an exciting time to be interested in such models.</p>
