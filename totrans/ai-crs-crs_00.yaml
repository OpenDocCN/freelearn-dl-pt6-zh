- en: Hello, data scientists and AI enthusiasts. For many years I've created online
    courses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which have been very successful and contributed
    well to the AI community. However, something essential was missing. At one point,
    so many AI courses were made that most of my students asked me for guidance on
    how to take the courses. So instead of providing an order in which to take the
    courses, I decided to create an all-in-one full guide to AI as a book, which would
    include in a perfect structure all the best explanations and real-world practical
    activities from my courses.

- en: You see, my goal is to democratize AI and raise awareness among everyone of
    the fact that AI is an accessible technology that can make a difference for the
    better in this world. I am trying my best to spread knowledge around the world
    to get people prepared for the future jobs and opportunities of this 21st century.
    And I thought some people would learn AI much more efficiently from an all-in-one
    book they can take anywhere, rather than completing tens of online courses that
    can be hard to navigate. That being said, this book is also a great additional
    resource for those people who do prefer, and take, online courses.

- en: My simple hope for this book is that more people learn AI the right way, as
    a result of me offering them this efficient alternative to online courses. I've
    succeeded at the challenge of including the best of my training in a single book,
    and today I'm truly happy to release it. I sincerely hope it will help more people
    land their dream job, grow an amazing career in data science or AI, and bring
    beautiful solutions to the tough challenges of this 21st century.
