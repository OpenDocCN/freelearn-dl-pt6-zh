The interest in this field by companies, universities, governments, and research organizations has accelerated the advances in the field. This book covers select important advances in deep learning. The advanced theories are explained by giving a background of the principles, digging into the intuition behind the concepts, implementing the equations and algorithms using Keras, and examining the results.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AI</strong></span>), as it stands today, is still far from being a well-understood field. Deep learning, as a sub field of AI, is in the same position. While it is far from being a mature field, many real-world applications such as vision-based detection and recognition, product recommendation, speech recognition and synthesis, energy conservation, drug discovery, finance, and marketing are already using deep learning algorithms. Many more applications will be discovered and built. The aim of this book is to explain advanced concepts, give sample implementations, and let the readers, as experts in their field, identify the target applications.</p><p>A field that is not completely mature is a double-edged sword. On one edge, it offers a lot of opportunities for discovery and exploitation. There are many unsolved problems in deep learning. This translates into opportunities to be the first to market – product development, publication, or recognition. The other edge is that it would be difficult to trust a not completely well-understood field in a mission-critical environment. We can safely say that if asked, very few machine learning engineers will ride an auto-pilot plane controlled by a deep learning system. There is a lot of work to be done to gain this level of trust. The advanced concepts that are discussed in this book have a high chance of playing a major role as the foundation in gaining this level of trust.</p><p>Every book in deep learning will not be able to completely cover the whole field. This book is not an exception. Given the time and space, we could have touched interesting areas such as detection, segmentation and recognition, visual understanding, probabilistic reasoning, natural language processing and understanding, speech synthesis, and automated machine learning. However, this book believes in choosing and explaining select areas so that readers can take up other fields that are not covered.</p><p>As the reader is about to read the rest of this book, they need to keep in mind that they chose an area that is exciting and can have a huge impact on the society. We are fortunate to have a job that we look forward to working on as we wake up in the morning.</p><div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec001"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>The book is intended for machine learning engineers and students who would like to gain a better understanding of advanced topics in deep learning. Each discussion is supplemented with code implementation in Keras. This book is for readers who would like to understand how to translate theory into a working code implementation in Keras. Apart from understanding theories, code implementation is usually one of the difficult tasks in applying machine learning to real-world problems.</p></div></div>

<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introducing Advanced Deep Learning with Keras">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Advanced Deep Learning with Keras</em></span>, covers the key concepts of deep learning such as optimization, regularization, loss functions, fundamental layers, and networks and their implementation in Keras. This chapter also serves as a review of both deep learning and Keras using sequential API.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Deep Neural Networks">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deep Neural Networks</em></span>, discusses the functional API of Keras. Two widely-used deep network architectures, ResNet and DenseNet, are examined and implemented in Keras, using functional API.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Autoencoders">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Autoencoders</em></span>, covers a common network structure called autoencoder that is used to discover the latent representation of the input data. Two example applications of autoencoders, denoising and colorization, are discussed and implemented in Keras.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</em></span>, discusses one of the recent significant advances in deep learning. GAN is used to generate new synthetic data that appear real. This chapter explains the principles of GAN. Two examples of GAN, DCGAN and CGAN, are examined and implemented in Keras.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Improved GANs">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Improved GANs</em></span>, covers algorithms that improve the basic GAN. The algorithms address the difficulty in training GANs and improve the perceptual quality of synthetic data. WGAN, LSGAN, and ACGAN are discussed and implemented in Keras.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Disentangled Representation GANs">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Disentangled Representation GANs</em></span>, discusses how to control the attributes of the synthetic data generated by GANs. The attributes can be controlled if the latent representations are disentangled. Two techniques in disentangling representations, InfoGAN and StackedGAN, are covered and implemented in Keras.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Cross-Domain GANs">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cross-Domain GANs</em></span>, covers a practical application of GANs, translating images from one domain to another or commonly known as cross-domain transfer. CycleGAN, a widely used cross-domain GAN, is discussed and implemented in Keras. This chapter also demonstrates CycleGAN performing colorization and style transfer.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</em></span>, discusses another recent significant advance in deep learning. Similar to GAN, VAE is a generative model that is used to produce synthetic data. Unlike GAN, VAE focuses on decodable continuous latent space that is suitable for variational inference. VAE and its variations, CVAE and <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/B08956_08_121.jpg" alt="What this book covers"/></span>-VAE, are covered and implemented in Keras.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Deep Reinforcement Learning">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deep Reinforcement Learning</em></span>, explains the principles of reinforcement learning and Q-Learning. Two techniques in implementing Q-Learning for discrete action spaces are presented, Q Table update and Deep Q Network (DQN). Implementation of Q-Learning using Python and DQN in Keras are demonstrated in OpenAI gym environments.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Policy Gradient Methods">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Policy Gradient Methods</em></span>, explains how to use neural networks to learn the policy for decision making in reinforcement learning. Four methods are covered and implemented in Keras and OpenAI gym environment, REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline, Actor-Critic, and Advantage Actor-Critic. The example presented in this chapter demonstrates policy gradient methods on a continuous action space.</p></div>
