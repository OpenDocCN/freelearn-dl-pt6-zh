# How to Improve Your NLP Skills

This appendix will give you more information about how you can improve your skills in NLP. This will also help you update your knowledge.

# Beginning a new career journey with NLP

If you are a coder and want to pursue a career in NLP, then keep the following things in mind:

*   NLP, as well as AI, is growing so fast that it will not be enough for you to just acquire the skills. You also need to update them.
*   Kaggle is one of the best learning platforms for all NLP and data science folks. If you are hearing about this hackathon platform for the first time, then I'm sure that by clicking on this link, you will not be disappointed: [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/).
*   Participate in Kaggle competitions. Learn, discuss, and implement.
*   GitHub is your new resume if you are from a coding background. So, try to make new projects and put them on your GitHub.
*   Contribute to open source community projects. This will help your thinking process, as well as your coding skills.
*   Attend various conferences. Try to explore new ideas and techniques.
*   Read research papers and articles.
*   Be a part of communities and conversations.
*   Ask questions. In short, just unlock yourself.
*   Think about the product architecture.
*   Combine all your learning and try to see the big picture for your development product.
*   If you are thinking that you have learned enough, then think again. Sometimes, use cases, applications, and so on that you have tried are so similar that you don't find things very interesting. Recall all your learning and experiences. Give your thoughts a better and new direction (just like Newton or Einstein. They stopped learning and started thinking and gave us great theories of science). Try to make something useful that impacts others' lives in a positive manner.

# Cheat sheets

I'm providing cheat sheets for libraries and frameworks on this link:

[https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/tree/master/Appendix2/Cheatsheets](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/NLPython/tree/master/Appendix2/Cheatsheets)

Cheat sheets cover the following libraries, tools, and frameworks. These cheat sheets were not developed by me. I want to give full credit to individual authors who have made the cheat sheets for the following topics:

*   Linux books for beginners
*   Python
*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   pandas
*   Fask
*   scikit-learn
*   TensorFlow API at [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/)
*   TensorFlow cheat sheet at [https://github.com/crscardellino/cheatsheets/blob/master/tensorflow.md](https://github.com/crscardellino/cheatsheets/blob/master/tensorflow.md) which was made by Cristian Cardellino
*   Keras
*   PySpark
*   Math
*   Git
*   Linux

# Choose your area

After reading all the chapters, you might know enough to decide what you like. Do you want to build core ML stuff? Do you like to work on frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, and so on? Are you keen on designing architecture? Do you want to contribute to visualization? Think and choose.

You can choose any area from data science or you can be a part of the whole data science product development life cycle. I want to give my example. I have worked with mid-size and start-up organizations. So far, I have had the freedom to explore various areas related to data science, such as proposing a data science product and releasing the product. I used to propose a new product after doing an analysis of business opportunities. I always validate my product proposal by thinking that if we were to make this product, then our end users would use it and, in return, the company that I'm working for will get the positive impact of it. Then, I would start work on the designing part by asking many questions, such as what kind of data will we need, what data resources will we use, what are the critical data points that we need to collect, what will the architecture of the product, what machine learning models will we use, how will we integrate with the existing product be, when will we release it, and so on. If you think like me and want to work on all the areas, as well as on each and every component of the data science product, then it is a very good thing. Just do your work from your heart and with passion. See the big picture as well.

# Agile way of working to achieve success

NLP or any other data science-related projects need many iterations to get optimal output. You need to understand the problem statement. After this, to achieve the best result, you need to start with an analysis of your data. After analyzing the data, make a basic prototype. Then validate your model. If it gives you the best result, then you are done; if not, then try to implement different algorithms, do hyperparameter tuning, or change or improve your features set. You need to be agile in your working process. Try to identify your problem or mistake and then do smart iterations. Ask questions on stack overflow. Try to search for answers. This will really help you. Keep yourself updated with all the techniques and tools. There are some libraries that can solve your issue. Look for any paid third-party tool available and try to understand how it works. There are chances that, after using the tool, you could become a master of your product and your product could become more valuable for your end users.

# Summary

This entire section is more about discussing and sharing my views with you. These views may help you go ahead. I have given some suggestions, procedures, and areas that you can check and try to absorb if you like. I have listed down links of some useful blogs and other important links for publicly available datasets. I have also provided cheat sheets for different Python libraries.
