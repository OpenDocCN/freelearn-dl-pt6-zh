</div>

			<p class="normal">In this chapter, you'll get to grips with your very
 first AI model! You're going to make a model that will solve the very 
well-known multi-armed bandit problem. This is a classic problem in AI, 
and it's also widely encountered in many real-world business problems.</p>
			<h2 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_67" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>The multi-armed bandit problem</h2>
			<p class="normal">Imagine you are in<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> 
Las Vegas, in your favorite casino. You are in a room containing five 
slot machines. For each of them the game is the same: you bet a certain 
amount of money, say 1 dollar, you pull the arm, and then the machine 
will either take your money, or give you twice your money back. Remember
 the rewards we talked about in the previous chapter? Let's say that if 
the machine takes your money, your reward is -1, and if the machine 
returns you twice your money, your reward is +1.</p>
			<p class="normal">As you can see, you're already starting to define 
an AI environment, which I'll remind you is absolutely fundamental when 
solving a problem with AI. So far, the AI isn't there, but it will come 
soon. You always start by defining the environment.</p>
			<p class="normal">You've defined the rewards; you'll define the 
states (inputs) and actions (outputs) later. Now, still in the process 
of defining the environment, let's say that you know, somehow, that one 
of these machines has a higher probability of giving you a +1 reward 
than the others when you pull its arm. It doesn't matter how you know 
this info, but it must be part of the problem assumptions. Rest assured,
 this assumption is always naturally verified in the real-world business
 problems mentioned above where the multi-armed bandit problem can be 
applied.</p>
			<p class="normal">Your goal, as in any AI environment, is to obtain 
the highest accumulated reward during your time of play. Let's say you 
are going to bet 1,000 dollars in total, meaning that you are going to 
bet 1 dollar, 1,000 times, each time by pulling the arm of any of these 
five slot machines. The question is:</p>
			<p class="normal">What should be your strategy, so that after having 
played 1,000 times, you get the maximum amount of money to take home 
with you?</p>
			<p class="normal">The first step of your strategy <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>must
 be to figure out, in the minimum number of plays, which of these five 
slot machines has the highest chance of giving you a 1 reward. In other 
words, you have to quickly figure out the slot machine with the highest 
success rate. Then, as soon as you figure it out, you simply need to 
keep playing on that most successful slot machine.</p>
			<p class="normal">Finding the most successful slot machine is not 
hard; one simple strategy could be to play 100 times on each of these 
five slot machines and then, at the end, look at which of them gave you 
more money. Statistically, this gives you a good chance of finding that 
most generous slot machine.</p>
			<p class="normal">All the challenge is in "quickly". The hardest part is to find the best slot machine <strong class="bold">in a minimum number of trials</strong>. This is where your first AI model comes into play.</p>
			<h2 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_68" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>The Thompson Sampling model</h2>
			<p class="normal">You're going to build this model <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>straight
 away. Right now, you'll build a simple implementation of this method, 
and later you will be shown the theory behind it. Let's get right into 
it!</p>
			<p class="normal">As we defined previously, our problem is trying to 
find the best slot machine with the highest winning chance out of many. A
 not-so-optimal solution would be to play 100 rounds on each of our slot
 machines and see which one has the highest winning rate. A better 
solution is a method called Thompson Sampling.</p>
			<p class="normal">I won't go too deeply into the theory behind it; 
we'll cover that later. For now, it is enough to say that Thompson 
Sampling uses a distribution function (distributions will be explained 
further in this chapter), called Beta, that takes two arguments. For 
simplicity's sake, let's say that the higher the first argument is, the 
better our slot machine is, and the higher the second argument is, the 
worse our slot machine is.</p>
			<p class="normal">Therefore, we can define this function as:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_001.png" style="height: 1.75em;" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="normal">where:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list"><em class="italics">x</em> – a random choice from our Beta distribution</li>
				<li class="list"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_002.png" style="height: 1em;" alt=""/></span> – our Beta function</li>
				<li class="list"><em class="italics">a</em> – the first argument</li>
				<li class="list"><em class="italics">b</em> – the second argument</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Don't worry if you don't understand this<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> entirely quite yet; you'll read all about it later.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_69" lang="en-GB">Coding the mode<a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>l</h3>
			<p class="normal">Let's start coding our solution. All this <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>code is also available on the GitHub page of this book in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 05</code> folder. Here we go with the first code section:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs capnproto"><span class="hljs-comment"># Importing the libraries</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> np
</code></pre>
			
			<p class="normal">You'll only need one library, called NumPy. This is
 a very useful library, helping when we are dealing with 
multi-dimensional arrays and lists in general. Give it the abbreviation <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">np</code>, which is the industry standard, so that it will be easier to use.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now we have to understand something very important.
 You are creating a simulation whose aim is to simulate real-life 
situations. In reality, every slot machine gives us some chance of 
winning, and some machines have it higher than others. Therefore, when 
simulating this environment, you have to do the same thing. It is 
important to remember, however, that our AI will not know these 
predefined winning rates. It cannot just read them and judge, based on 
these rates, which machine is the best.</p>
			<p class="normal">For this example, let's call this list of winning chances <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">conversionRates</code>.</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs pgsql"># Setting <span class="hljs-keyword">conversion</span> rates <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> the number <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> samples
conversionRates = [<span class="hljs-number">0.15</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.04</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.13</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.11</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.05</span>]
N = <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>
d = len(conversionRates)
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">Here, you have five slot machines. They have some 
win chance; for example, slot machine no. 1 offers a 15% chance of a 
win. Then you create a number of samples, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">N</code>.
 Remember, you are performing a simulation, so you need to have a 
predefined dataset that will tell you whether you won or not when you're
 playing. You also introduce a variable, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">d</code>,
 which is the length of your conversion rates list; that is, the number 
of slot machines. It's useful to use short variable names like that, 
because the code would be longer and less readable otherwise.</p>
			<p class="normal">Do you have an idea of what you <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>should
 do next? You are running a simulation, so you need to have a predefined
 set of wins and losses for every slot machine for every sample. I 
highly recommend that you try to do this on your own. You need to have a
 set that will tell you if at some timestep <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">i</code> you have won or not by playing a certain slot machine. The answer is in the next snippet of code.</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs properties"><span class="hljs-comment"># Creating the dataset</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">X</span> = <span class="hljs-string">np.zeros((N, d))</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">for</span> <span class="hljs-string">i in range(N):</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">for</span> <span class="hljs-string">j in range(d):</span>
        <span class="hljs-attr">if</span> <span class="hljs-string">np.random.rand() &lt; conversionRates[j]:</span>
            <span class="hljs-meta">X[i][j]</span> = <span class="hljs-string">1</span>
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">In the first line, you create a 2d-array full of zeros, of size <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">N * d</code>. This means that you've created an array with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">N</code> (in this case <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">10000</code>) rows and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">d</code> (in this case <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">5</code>) columns. Then, in a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code> loop, you iterate through every row in that 2d-array <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">X</code>. In a nested <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code>
 loop, you iterate through each column in that row. In line 5 of the 
preceding code snippet, for each slot machine (each column), we check if
 a random float number from range (0,1) is smaller than the conversion 
rate for the corresponding slot machine.</p>
			<p class="normal">That's just like playing the slot machine; since 
there is an equal chance of getting any float number from this range, 
the chances of getting a number smaller than <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">x</code> (where <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">x</code> is also in range (0,1)) is equal to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">x</code>. For example, for <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">d</code>
 = 0.15, there are 15 instances out of 100 of getting a smaller float 
number than 0.15, and thus a 15% chance of returning a high reward for 
slot machine 1. In other words, if the random float is smaller, then 
that means you will win if you play this certain machine at this certain
 timestep.</p>
			<p class="normal">To make sure you understand, if one of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">N</code> samples from your dataset <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">X</code> looks like this: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]</code>, you would win at that point in time by playing slot machine no. 2 or no. 5.</p>
			<p class="normal">Next, you need to create two arrays that will count
 how many times you have lost and won by playing each slot machine, like
 this:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs ini"><span class="hljs-comment"># Making arrays to count our losses and wins</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">nPosReward</span> = np.zeros(d)
<span class="hljs-attr">nNegReward</span> = np.zeros(d)
</code></pre>
			
			
			<p class="normal">Name them <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> (number of wins) and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code> (number of losses).</p>
			<p class="normal">Now that you have made a simulation set and these 
two counters, you can start coding some Thompson Sampling. Keep in mind 
that the theory, as well as another example, will be covered later.</p>
			<p class="normal">Next, initialize a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code> loop that will iterate<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> through every sample in our dataset and choose the best slot machine. Initially, only create two variables, one called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">selected</code>, which will tell you which slot machine was chosen, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">maxRandom</code>, which you will use to get the highest Beta distribution guess across all slot machines:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs armasm"># Taking our <span class="hljs-keyword">best </span>slot machine through <span class="hljs-keyword">beta </span>distribution <span class="hljs-keyword">and </span>updating <span class="hljs-keyword">its </span>losses <span class="hljs-keyword">and </span>wins
<span class="hljs-symbol">for</span> i in range(N):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">selected </span>= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
    maxRandom = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">So now you can get to the core of Thompson 
Sampling. You'll take random guesses from our Beta distribution and find
 the highest value across all your slot machines.</p>
			<p class="normal">You can use a method taken from NumPy, called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">np.random.beta(a,b)</code>,
 that returns this random guess. Knowing that, try to find the highest 
guess and the best machine on your own! It is totally fine if you 
fail—we haven't covered the theory yet—and I will provide you with an 
answer. Good luck!</p>
			<p class="normal">I hope you've given it a try. Whether it's worked out for you or not, here's my answer:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs pf">    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> j <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> range(d):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">random</span>Beta = np.<span class="hljs-keyword">random</span>.beta(nP<span class="hljs-keyword">os</span>Reward[j] + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, nNegReward[j] + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
        if <span class="hljs-keyword">random</span>Beta &gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">max</span>Random:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">max</span>Random = <span class="hljs-keyword">random</span>Beta
            selected = j
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">You haven't missed anything—this is all the<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> code needed for this task. You create a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code> loop to iterate through every slot machine and find the best one. For each slot machine of index <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">j</code> (remember that you are still in the bigger <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code> loop with index <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">i</code>), you take a random draw, called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">randomBeta</code>, from our Beta distribution, and check if it is greater than <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">maxRandom</code>.</p>
			<p class="normal">If it is, then you reassign <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">maxRandom</code> to be equal to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">randomBeta</code>, and set <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">selected</code> to be equal to the index of this new highest-guess slot machine <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">j</code>. It is also worth mentioning what the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">a</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">b</code>
 arguments of the Beta function are in this case; they're the number of 
wins and losses we've had on the specific slot machine. Remember, the 
bigger the first argument, the better, and the higher our random guess 
will be; the bigger the second argument, the worse, and the lower our 
random guess will be.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now that you have selected the best slot machine, what do you think you should do next?</p>
			<p class="normal">You have to update your <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> or <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code> depending on whether you have won or not. We can do that with this code:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs angelscript">    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> X[i][selected] == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
        nPosReward[selected] += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
        nNegReward[selected] += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">Here, you can see the use of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">X</code> array you created earlier. You check if you have won this round by checking if there's a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">1</code> in the appropriate place in your <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">X</code> array. If you win, you update the index corresponding to the selected machine in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> by adding <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">1</code>. If you lose, however, you update <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code> by adding <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">1</code>
 in the same index there. You can clearly see that if you win, next 
time, your random guess from the Beta distribution for that machine will
 be higher; and if you lose, it will be lower.</p>
			<p class="normal">This code works already, although it is worth 
adding a few lines of code to display which slot machine your code 
considers the best:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs hsp"><span class="hljs-meta"># Showing which slot machine is considered the best</span>
nSelected = nPosReward + nNegReward 
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i in range(d):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Machine number '</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">str</span>(i + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) + <span class="hljs-string">' was selected '</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">str</span>(nSelected[i]) + <span class="hljs-string">' times'</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Conclusion: Best machine is machine number '</span> + <span class="hljs-keyword">str</span>(np.argmax(nSelected) + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>))
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">Here, you simply display how many times each slot 
machine was chosen by your algorithm. To get these numbers you can add 
together the lists <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code>. In the final line, you<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> show which machine was chosen the highest number of times, making it the slot machine that is considered the best.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, you can just run your code and see the results:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting language-markup"><code class="hljs angelscript">Machine number <span class="hljs-number">1</span> was selected <span class="hljs-number">7927.0</span> times
Machine number <span class="hljs-number">2</span> was selected <span class="hljs-number">82.0</span> times
Machine number <span class="hljs-number">3</span> was selected <span class="hljs-number">1622.0</span> times
Machine number <span class="hljs-number">4</span> was selected <span class="hljs-number">306.0</span> times
Machine number <span class="hljs-number">5</span> was selected <span class="hljs-number">63.0</span> times
Conclusion: Best machine <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> machine number <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class="normal">As we can see, your algorithm <strong class="bold">quickly</strong> found out that machine no. 1 is the best. It did it in around 2,000 rounds (2,000 samples in your <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">X</code> <a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>set).</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_70" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Understanding the model</h3>
			<p class="normal">Thompson Sampling is, by far, the best<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>
 model for this kind of problem; at the end of this chapter, you will 
see a comparison with another method. Here's how it works its magic. The
 first thing we do, when finding the best slot machine, is obviously to 
play the arm of each of the five slot machines one by one. So here we 
go:</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Round 1</strong>: We play the arm of slot machine number 1. Let's say we get reward 0.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Round 2</strong>: We play the arm of slot machine number 2. Let's say we get reward 1.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Round 3</strong>: We play the arm of slot machine number 3. Let's say we get reward 0.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Round 4</strong>: We play the arm of slot machine number 4. Let's say we get reward 0.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Round 5</strong>: We play the arm of slot machine number 5. Let's say we get reward 1.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, why do you think we had to do this? We only 
did that to collect some starting information from each of the slot 
machines. This information will be needed in future rounds.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, things start to get interesting. What are we going to do at round 6? Which arm are we going to play?</p>
			<p class="normal">Well, we need to look back at what happened during 
the first five rounds. For each slot machine, we introduce two new 
variables, one that counts the number of times the slot machine returned
 a 0 reward, and another one that counts the number of times the slot 
machine returned a 1 reward.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's denote these variables as <img src="../Images/B14110_05_003.png" alt=""/> and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_004.png" alt=""/></span>, where <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_005.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times slot machine number <em class="italics">i</em> returned reward 0 up to round <em class="italics">n</em>, and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_006.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times slot machine number <em class="italics">i</em> returned<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> reward 1 up to round <em class="italics">n</em>. These two variables are denoted by <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> in our code. So, based on what we've obtained so far at round 5, let's give some values examples of these variables:</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_007.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 1 has returned 1 loss over 1 round.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_008.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 1 has returned 0 wins over 1 round.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_009.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 2 has returned 0 losses over 1 round.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_010.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 2 has returned 1 win over 1 round.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_011.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 5 has returned 0 losses over 4 rounds.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_012.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 5 has returned 0 wins over 4 rounds.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_013.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 5 has returned 0 losses over 5 rounds.</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_014.png" alt=""/></span> means that slot machine 5 has returned 1 win over 5 rounds.</p>
			<p class="normal">Alright, that was the easy part. The good news is 
that we've created all the variables we needed for our AI. The bad news 
is that now<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> comes the hard part, the math.
 If you think math is good news, I like your spirit; but don't worry if 
you don't like math, I won't let you down.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_71" lang="en-GB">Wha<a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>t is a distribution?</h3>
			<p class="normal">The next step of our AI journey is to introduce<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>
 distributions in mathematics. For this, I'll give you a simple 
definition with my own words, not the very formal ones you find in math 
books. I want to make sure everybody understands. Here it is: the 
distribution of a variable is a function that will give, for each value 
in the possible range of values the variable could take, the probability
 that this variable is equal to that value.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's really understand what it is through an example:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 1: The normal distribution</p>
			<p class="normal">In the preceding graph, you can see an example of a
 distribution. Now, remember in the definition I gave you, I mentioned 
two measures: "range of values the variable could take", and 
"probability that this variable is equal to that value". In any 
distribution, on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis you have the range of values the variable could take, and on the <em class="italics">y</em>-axis you have the probability that the variable is equal to each value.</p>
			<p class="normal">Don't worry if this isn't clear yet. To extend our 
example, let's say that on the preceding graph, this variable is the 
annual salary people have in a specific country.</p>
			<p class="normal">On the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, we would have the <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>range
 of annual salaries from the minimum wage to the maximum wage, let's say
 from 15,000 dollars to 150,000 dollars. And on the <em class="italics">y</em>-axis, we would have the probabilities that a person would have that salary.</p>
			<p class="normal">Now it should make more sense. For the low 
salaries, the curve is low, meaning that the probability that an 
individual earns a salary of around 15,000 dollars is low.</p>
			<p class="normal">Then, up to the center of the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, marked as <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_015.png" alt=""/></span>, which is the average of the salaries, the probabilities of people's salaries increase. Let's say that <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_016.png" alt=""/></span>
 is equal to 45,000 dollars. We intuitively understand that the 
probability that an individual in a specific country earns 45,000 
dollars per year is the highest, simply because the majority of people 
earn something in the region of 45,000 dollars per year. And that's 
exactly why the distribution in the graph is the highest at this salary.</p>
			<p class="normal">The higher we go above an annual salary of 45,000 
dollars, the fewer people we'll find earning such salaries, and 
therefore the probability of people earning such salaries will decrease,
 until we go beyond an annual salary of 150,000 dollars, where very few 
people earn that much, therefore leading to a close-to-zero probability.</p>
			<p class="normal">Alright, that was the distribution explained 
intuitively. Now, you have to know that there are many types of 
distributions: Gaussian distributions (that look like the preceding 
graph), normal distributions (Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and 
variance 1), Beta distributions, and many more.</p>
			<p class="normal">That's the next step: <strong class="bold">Beta distributions</strong>.
 The Beta distribution is at the heart of the AI we built to solve our 
bandit problem. Here are what Beta distributions look like:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2: Three Beta distributions</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's do some practice to make sure you <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>understand
 how distributions work. Imagine these three distributions correspond to
 three different countries, and again let's say that they are the 
distributions of salaries in these countries. Which country has the 
highest salaries? Is it the purple one, the green one, or the yellow 
one? The answer is the yellow one, of course! It is in this country that
 we have positive probabilities for the highest salaries (remember, the 
salaries are on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, and the probabilities are on the <em class="italics">y</em>-axis).</p>
			<p class="normal">That was just a quick test to make sure you were 
with me. Now, you don't have to remember the exact formula of a Beta 
distribution, but you do have to know that it has two parameters and how
 they impact the distribution. Don't forget that this was already 
mentioned when we solved the problem in practice, now it is explained in
 much more detail.</p>
			<p class="normal">If we denote these two parameters as <em class="italics">a</em> and <em class="italics">b</em> again, we can denote the Beta distribution with the following:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_0011.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="normal">You might be asking what just happened—Why did <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_018.png" alt=""/></span> appear? Don't worry, we will demystify all this. In the formula above, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_019.png" alt=""/></span> is the probability, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_020.png" alt=""/></span> is a function of <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_021.png" alt=""/></span> only, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_022.png" alt=""/></span> is the salary, and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_023.png" alt=""/></span> are the two parameters present in any Beta distribution. Again, you don't have to know the exact definition of the function <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_024.png" alt=""/></span>, but just keep in mind the shape of its curve as given in the preceding graph.</p>
			<p class="normal">However, what is really important for<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> you to understand now is the role of the two parameters <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_025.png" alt=""/></span> and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_026.png" alt=""/></span>. Following are the two points that you must know and visualize in your head:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="list">Given two Beta distributions with the same parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_027.png" alt=""/></span>, the one having a larger parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_028.png" alt=""/></span> will be shifted more to the right.</li>
				<li class="list">Given two Beta distributions with the same parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_029.png" alt=""/></span>, the one having a larger parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_030.png" alt=""/></span> will be shifted more to the left.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">That's it! That's enough to have an intuitive 
understanding of how our AI will solve the Bandit problem. In other 
words, the larger the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_031.png" alt=""/></span>, the more it will shift the Beta distribution to the right, and the larger the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_032.png" alt=""/></span>, the more it will shift the Beta distribution to the left.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's practice this! If I give you the following three Beta distributions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="list" value="1"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_033.png" alt=""/></li>
				<li class="list"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_034.png" alt=""/></li>
				<li class="list"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_035.png" alt=""/></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="normal">Could you tell me which of the three Beta distributions in the following graph they would approximately look like?</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3: Three Beta distributions</p>
			<p class="normal">Based on the two statements above, <img src="../Images/B14110_05_036.png" alt=""/> is the purple one, <img src="../Images/B14110_05_037.png" alt=""/> is the yellow one, and <img src="../Images/B14110_05_038.png" alt=""/> is the green one. Congratulations<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> to you if you guessed that right!</p>
			<p class="normal">Now you are ready to solve our bandit problem. But 
let me ask you a question first, which might lead you to understand the 
magic faster than this book:</p>
			<p class="normal">If, instead of the salaries in a country, the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis
 contained the success rates of the machines in the casino, and if each 
of the three Beta distributions represented one particular slot machine,
 which one would you choose to bet your 1,000 dollars?</p>
			<p class="normal">You would choose the yellow one!</p>
			<p class="normal">Of course! This distribution has positive 
probabilities for the highest conversion rates, since it is the one most
 shifted to the right.</p>
			<p class="normal">This was already discussed in the previous code 
section of this chapter; I told you there that the higher the first 
parameter, the better the slot machine. Indeed, the Beta distribution 
will be shifted more to the right, meaning that this slot machine has a 
higher chance of giving us a win. Additionally, the higher the second 
parameter, the worse the slot machine is and now, the Beta distribution 
will be shifted to the left, meaning that this machine has a lower 
chance of us winning.</p>
			<p class="normal">And now another question, before we <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>solve
 our bandit problem. Remembering that you have five slot machines to 
play with, try to answer this question: if the five slot machines are 
associated with the following five Beta distributions of success rates:</p>
			<p class="normal"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_039.png" alt=""/></span>, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_040.png" alt=""/></span>, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_041.png" alt=""/></span>, <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_042.png" alt=""/></span>, and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_043.png" alt=""/></span>,</p>
			<p class="normal">Which one would you pick to bet your 1,000 dollars?</p>
			<p class="normal">The answer is <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_044.png" alt=""/></span>!</p>
			<p class="normal">Of course, again! Because it is the one with the largest parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_045.png" alt=""/></span> and the lowest parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_046.png" alt=""/></span>, therefore the most shifted to the right, and hence the one having the positive probabilities for the highest conversion rates.</p>
			<p class="normal">If you are still with me, you are definitely ready 
to understand the AI magic. If not, please read through this section 
again. In the next section, I will finally reveal what happens next 
after Round 5.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_72" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Tackling the MABP</h3>
			<p class="normal">What we are goi<a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>ng to do from now <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>on before playing each round is to<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> associate each slot machine with a specific Beta distribution. At each round <em class="italics">n</em>, the slot machine number <em class="italics">i</em> (<em class="italics">i</em>=1,2,3,4,5) will be associated with the following Beta distribution:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_048.png" style="height: 2em;" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="normal">Here, you should recall the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_049.png" alt=""/> is the number of times the slot machine number <img src="../Images/B14110_05_050.png" alt=""/> returned a 1 reward up to round <img src="../Images/B14110_05_051.png" alt=""/>.</li>
				<li class="list"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_052.png" alt=""/> is the number of times the slot machine number <img src="../Images/B14110_05_053.png" alt=""/> returned a 0 reward up to round <img src="../Images/B14110_05_054.png" alt=""/>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Remember, in the Beta distribution <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_055.png" alt=""/></span>, the higher the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_056.png" alt=""/></span>, the more that shifts the distribution to the right. The higher the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_057.png" alt=""/></span>, the more that shifts the distribution to the left. Therefore, since at each round <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_058.png" alt=""/></span> and for each slot machine, the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_059.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times (plus 1) it returned 1 up to round <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_060.png" alt=""/></span>,
and the parameter <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_061.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times (plus 1) it returned 0 up to round <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_062.png" alt=""/></span>,
 then that means the following: the more the slot machine returns 1 
(success), the more its distribution will be shifted to the right; and 
the more the slot machine returns 0 (failure), the more its distribution
 will be shifted to the left.</p>
			<p class="normal">Congratulations if you<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> figured out what <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_063.png" alt=""/></span> and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_064.png" alt=""/></span> should be on your own. We<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> already used them in the practical tutorial above; we had two arrays, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nPosReward</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nNegReward</code>, that correspond to <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_065.png" alt=""/></span> and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_066.png" alt=""/> </span>respectively.</p>
			<p class="normal">Once you understand this, try to figure out the strategy before I give you the solution.</p>
			<p class="normal">Alright, you are about to see the magic. What we 
are going to do, before playing the arm at each round, is take a random 
draw from each of the five distributions corresponding to the five slot 
machines. In case you're not clear what that means, I'll explain. Let me
 show you again the graph of the three Beta distributions:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4: Three Beta distributions</p>
			<p class="normal">What did I mean by taking a random draw? First, remember that for our bandit problem, on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, we<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> have the success rates from 0 to 1. For example, <em class="italics">x</em> = 0.25 means that the machine returns a 1 reward (success) 25% of the time. Then, on the <em class="italics">y</em>-axis, we still have the probabilities to have these success rates.</p>
			<p class="normal">Let's focus on one <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>distribution,
 for example, the purple one. What would it mean to take a random draw 
from that distribution? That would mean very simply that we randomly 
pick a value on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis where the distribution is positive, such that the <em class="italics">x</em>
 values where the probability is the highest will get the highest chance
 to be picked. For example, let's say the top of the purple curve 
corresponds to <em class="italics">x</em> = 0.2 and <em class="italics">y</em> = 0.35.</p>
			<p class="normal">Then, taking a random draw from that purple 
distribution means that we will have a 35% chance to pick a success rate
 of 20%. To generalize this, let's say that <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_067.png" alt=""/></span>
 is the function associated with the purple distribution, so taking a 
random draw from that purple distribution means that for each success 
rate <em class="italics">x</em> on the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, we will have <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_068.png" alt=""/></span> chance of picking <em class="italics">x</em>. That is what "to take a random draw from a distribution" means, and this is also called "to sample a distribution".</p>
			<p class="normal">Now that you understand this, let's see where we 
left off. We said that before playing the arm at each round, we were 
going to take a random draw from each of the five distributions 
corresponding to the five slot machines. We thus obtain five values on 
the <em class="italics">x</em>-axis, each one corresponding to each of 
the five slot machines. Then, here comes the crucial question, the one 
that will tell whether you have the right intuition about the strategy.</p>
			<p class="normal"><strong class="bold">According to you, which slot machine are you going to play, based on the observation of these five values?</strong>
 I really want you to take some time to answer this question, because 
right now, we are at the heart of the strategy (you can also have a look
 at our previously written code). The answer can be found in the next 
paragraph.</p>
			<p class="normal">I really hope you tried figuring this out by 
yourself: the slot machine that you are going to play next is the one 
for which we got the highest of the five random draws. Why? Because the 
highest random draws correspond to the highest success rate, and for 
this highest success rate, the Beta distribution associated with the 
slot machine picked has positive probabilities around that highest 
success rate.</p>
			<p class="normal">Since we want to maximize the success rate of the 
machines we play (because we want to make money), we must pick the slot 
machine for which the Beta distribution has positive probabilities 
around the highest success rates. In the following graph, that's the 
yellow distribution.</p>

			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5: Three Beta distributions</p>
			<p class="normal">Now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>must take a step back. I've <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>been
 in your situation many times when I am learning something new and 
technical, which sometimes felt overwhelming. In that case, the best 
move is to take a step back, which is exactly what we are going to do 
now by giving a recap of the strategy and its intuition.</p>

			<p class="normal">Af<a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>ter we play each of the five slot<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> machines over the first five rounds, here's what the AI will do at each round <img src="../Images/B14110_05_069.png" alt=""/>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="list" value="1">For each slot machine <em class="italics">i</em> (<em class="italics">i</em>=1,2,3,4,5), we take a random draw <img src="../Images/B14110_05_070.png" alt=""/> from its Beta distribution:<p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_071.png" alt=""/></span></p><p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">where:</p><p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_072.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times the slot machine number <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_073.png" alt=""/></span> returned a 1 reward up to round <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_074.png" alt=""/></span>.</p><p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet-End--PACKT-"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_075.png" alt=""/></span> is the number of times the slot machine number <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_076.png" alt=""/></span> returned a 0 reward up to round <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_062.png" alt=""/></span>.</p></li>
				<li class="list">We pull the arm of the slot machine <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_078.png" alt=""/></span> that has the highest sampled <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_079.png" alt=""/></span>:<p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet-End--PACKT-"><span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_080.png" alt=""/></span></p></li>

			</ol>
			<p class="normal">Then, we repeat these three steps at each round until we spend our 1,000 dollars. This strategy, called Thompson Sampling, is a<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> basic but powerful model of a specific branch of AI, called Reinforcement Learning.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_74" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>The final touch of shaping your Thompson Sampling intuition</h3>
			<p class="normal">You<a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>r intuition about why and how this <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>works should be as follows (try to keep it in mind or visualize it on the graphic):</p>
			<p class="normal">Each slot machine has its own Beta distribution. 
Over the rounds, the Beta distribution of the slot machine with the 
highest conversion rate will be progressively shifted to the right, and 
the Beta distributions of the strategies with lower conversion rates 
will be progressively shifted to the left (Steps 1 and 3). Therefore, 
because of Step 2, the slot machine with the highest conversion rate 
will be selected more and more.</p>
			<p class="normal">And voilà! Congratulations—you just learned about a
 powerful AI model, a massive step in your journey. To see Thompson 
Sampling in action and check that it indeed works, I won't force you to 
go to a casino and try it out; We'll apply it to another real-life model
 in <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">AI for Sales and Advertising – Sell like the Wolf of AI Street</em>. </p>
			<p class="normal">Finally, let me finish this theory tutorial with a question fo<a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>r
 you. Remember earlier in the book I told you that any AI we build today
 takes as input a state, returns as output an action to play, and, after
 playing the action, gets a reward (positive or negative). <strong class="bold">For this particular bandit problem, what are the input states, the actions played, and the rewards received?</strong> Think about this before reading the next paragraph.</p>
			<p class="normal">Here we go with the answer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="list">The input state is the exact round we've reached, including the information of the two parameters <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_087.png" alt=""/></span> and <span class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_088.png" alt=""/></span>.</li>
				<li class="list">The output action is the arm we pull from the selected slot machine.</li>
				<li class="list">The reward is 1 or 0, 1 if the slot machine returns twice our dollar invested, and 0 if we lose our dollar.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="normal">Congratulations to you if you answered that one 
correctly, and for tackling this first AI model, Thompson Sampling. And 
don't forget, in <em class="italics">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italics">AI for Sales and Advertising – Sell like the Wolf of AI Street</em>, we put this into <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>practice to solve a real-world business problem.</p>
			<h3 class="title" xml:lang="en-GB" id="sigil_toc_id_75" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Thompson Sampling against the standard model</h3>
			<p class="normal">When I learned Thompso<a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>n <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>Sampling
 for the first time, I had one main question in my mind: is it really 
that good? In fact, if you were to run the standard model (by "standard 
model" I mean playing every slot machine a certain number of times) and<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>
 Thompson Sampling separately you might not see much difference; you 
would likely come to the conclusion that they work pretty much as well 
as each other.</p>
			<p class="normal">To check whether it is true that Thompson Sampling 
isn't any better, I implemented a code to test both solutions on many 
different scenarios. The changes included: number of samples (200 or 
1,000 or 5,000), number of slot machines (from 3 to 20), and conversion 
rate ranges (ranges in which conversion rates could be set: 0-0.1; 
0-0.3; 0-0.5).</p>
			<p class="normal">Every scenario was tested 100 times to compute the accuracy of each model.</p>
			<p class="normal">The results and the code used are provided in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">resultsModified.xlsx</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">comparison.py</code> files, respectively, in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 05</code> of this book's GitHub page. Here, you can see some graphs taken from this Excel file that show the performance of both models:</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6: Accuracy vs. Number of slot machines (200 samples)</p>
			<p class="normal">This first graph in <em class="italics">Figure 6</em> illustrates the<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>
 accuracy of both models depending on the number of slot machines. The 
number of samples was set to 200 and the conversion rate ranges were set
 to 0-0.1, meaning that the differences between these rates were minor. 
This is the toughest setting for this comparison. Overall, Thompson 
Sampling performed better than the standard model (22% better).</p>
			<figure class="mediaobject" xml:lang="en-GB" lang="en-GB"><img src="../Images/B14110_05_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
			<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7: Accuracy vs. Number of slot machines (5,000 samples)</p>
			<p class="normal">This second graph in <em class="italics">Figure 7</em> shows the<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>
 performance under the easiest conditions. The number of samples was set
 to 5,000 and the conversion rate ranges were set to 0-0.5, meaning that
 the differences were clearly visible. The overall drop of accuracy for 
Thompson Sampling is smaller than the drop in accuracy for the standard 
solution. Thompson Sampling performed significantly better this time 
(41% better).</p>
			<p class="normal">Taking all scenarios into consideration, Thompson 
Sampling achieved a mean accuracy of 57% and the standard model achieved
 43% accuracy. This is a significant difference taking into account the 
fact that very tough scenarios were tested (for example, only 200 
samples, a range of 0-0.1, and 20 slot machines).</p>

			<p class="normal">Thompson Sampling is a powerful sampling technique 
that enables you to quickly figure out the highest of a number of 
unknown conversion rates. It is always applied in the same frame, called
 the multi-armed bandit problem, which in the classic sense is composed 
of several slot machines, each one having a different conversion rate of
 positive outcomes. We had a first glance at how this AI solves this 
problem better and faster than standard methods.</p>
			<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will perform a full 
practical activity where we will see how the multi-armed bandit frame 
can easily model a business problem—online advertising—and how Thompson 
Sampling can bring significant added value.</p>
