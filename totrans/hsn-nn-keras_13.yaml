    to see how this topic may develop in the future, pointing out potentially new
    and unexplored paths for research, and business development alike. The implications
    for generative models and autoencoders will also be used to generate custom artificial
    images, and topics such as vid2vid, deep fakes, and deep voice, will be examined.
