    don't find things very interesting. Recall all your learning and experiences.
    Give your thoughts a better and new direction (just like Newton or Einstein. They
    stopped learning and started thinking and gave us great theories of science).
    Try to make something useful that impacts others' lives in a positive manner.

    Hadoop, Spark, and so on? Are you keen on designing architecture? Do you want
    to contribute to visualization? Think and choose.

- en: You can choose any area from data science or you can be a part of the whole
    data science product development life cycle. I want to give my example. I have
    worked with mid-size and start-up organizations. So far, I have had the freedom
    to explore various areas related to data science, such as proposing a data science
    product and releasing the product. I used to propose a new product after doing
    an analysis of business opportunities. I always validate my product proposal by
    thinking that if we were to make this product, then our end users would use it
    and, in return, the company that I'm working for will get the positive impact
    of it. Then, I would start work on the designing part by asking many questions,
    such as what kind of data will we need, what data resources will we use, what
    are the critical data points that we need to collect, what will the architecture
    of the product, what machine learning models will we use, how will we integrate
    with the existing product be, when will we release it, and so on. If you think
    like me and want to work on all the areas, as well as on each and every component
    of the data science product, then it is a very good thing. Just do your work from
    your heart and with passion. See the big picture as well.

- en: NLP or any other data science-related projects need many iterations to get optimal
    output. You need to understand the problem statement. After this, to achieve the
    best result, you need to start with an analysis of your data. After analyzing
    the data, make a basic prototype. Then validate your model. If it gives you the
    best result, then you are done; if not, then try to implement different algorithms,
    do hyperparameter tuning, or change or improve your features set. You need to
    be agile in your working process. Try to identify your problem or mistake and
    then do smart iterations. Ask questions on stack overflow. Try to search for answers.
    This will really help you. Keep yourself updated with all the techniques and tools.
    There are some libraries that can solve your issue. Look for any paid third-party
    tool available and try to understand how it works. There are chances that, after
    using the tool, you could become a master of your product and your product could
    become more valuable for your end users.
