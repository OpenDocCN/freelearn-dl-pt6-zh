<p class="mce-root">Machine learning has made a huge impact on academia and industry by turning data into actionable intelligence. Scala, on the other hand, has been observing a steady rise in its adoption over the last few years, especially in the field of data science and analytics. This book has been written for data scientists, data engineers, and deep learning enthusiasts who have a solid background with complex numerical computing and want to learn more hands-on machine learning application development.</p>
<p class="mce-root">So, if you're well-versed in machine learning concepts and want to expand your knowledge by delving into practical implementations using the power of Scala, then this book is what you need! Through 11 end-to-end projects, you will be acquainted with popular machine learning libraries such as Spark ML, H2O, Zeppelin, DeepLearning4j, and MXNet.</p>
<p class="mce-root">After reading this book and practicing all of the projects, you will be able to dominate numerical computing, deep learning, and functional programming to carry out complex numerical tasks. You can thus develop, build, and deploy research and commercial projects in a production-ready environment.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book isn’t meant to be read cover to cover. You can turn the pages to a chapter that looks like something you’re trying to accomplish or that simply ignites your interest. But any kind of improvement feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p><span>If you want to leverage the power of both Scala and open source libraries such as Spark ML, Deeplearning4j, H2O, MXNet, and Zeppelin to make sense of Big Data, then this book is for you. A strong understanding of Scala and the Scala Play Framework is recommended. Basic familiarity with ML techniques will be an added advantage.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This book is dedicated to developers, data analysts, and deep learning enthusiasts who do not have much background with complex numerical computations but want to know what deep learning is. A strong understanding of Scala and its functional programming concepts is recommended. Some basic understanding and high-level knowledge of Spark ML, H2O, Zeppelin, DeepLearning4j, and MXNet would act as an added advantage in order to grasp this book. Additionally, basic know-how of build tools such as Maven and SBT is assumed.</p>
<p>All the examples have been implemented using Scala on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTs 64-bit and Windows 10 64-bit. You will also need the following (preferably the latest versions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Spark 2.0.0 (or higher)</li>
<li>MXNet, Zeppelin, DeepLearning4j, and H2O (see the details in the chapter and in the supplied <kbd>pom.xml</kbd> files)</li>
<li>Hadoop 2.7 (or higher)</li>
<li>Java (JDK and JRE) 1.7+/1.8+</li>
<li>Scala 2.11.x (or higher)</li>
<li>Eclipse Mars or Luna (latest) with Maven plugin (2.9+), Maven compiler plugin (2.3.2+), and Maven assembly plugin (2.4.1+)</li>
<li>IntelliJ IDE</li>
<li>SBT plugin and Scala Play Framework installed</li>
</ul>
<p>A computer with at least a Core i3 processor, Core i5 (recommended), or Core i7 (to get the best results) is needed. However, multicore processing will provide faster data processing and scalability. At least 8 GB RAM is recommended for standalone mode; use at least 32 GB RAM for a single VM and higher for a cluster. You should have enough storage for running heavy jobs (depending on the dataset size you will be handling); preferably, at least 50 GB of free disk storage (for standalone and for SQL Warehouse).</p>
<p>Linux distributions are preferable (including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and many more). To be more specific, for example, for Ubuntu it is recommended to have a 14.04 (LTS) 64-bit (or later) complete installation, VMWare player 12, or VirtualBox. You can run Spark jobs on Windows (XP/7/8/10) or Mac OS X (10.4.7+).</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>val cv = new CrossValidator()<br/>      .setEstimator(pipeline)<br/>      .setEvaluator(new RegressionEvaluator)<br/>      .setEstimatorParamMaps(paramGrid)<br/>      .setNumFolds(numFolds)</pre>
<p>Scala functional code blocks look as follows:</p>
<pre> def variantId(genotype: Genotype): String = {<br/>      val name = genotype.getVariant.getContigName<br/>      val start = genotype.getVariant.getStart<br/>      val end = genotype.getVariant.getEnd<br/>      s"$name:$start:$end"<br/>  }</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>var</strong> paramGrid = new ParamGridBuilder()<br/>      .addGrid(dTree.impurity, "gini" :: "entropy" :: Nil)<br/>      .addGrid(dTree.maxBins, 3 :: 5 :: 9 :: 15 :: 23 :: 31 :: Nil)<br/>      .addGrid(dTree.maxDepth, 5 :: 10 :: 15 :: 20 :: 25 :: 30 :: Nil)<br/>      .build()</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><span class="packt_screen"><strong>$ sudo mkdir Bitcoin</strong><br/><strong>$ cd Bitcoin</strong></span></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
