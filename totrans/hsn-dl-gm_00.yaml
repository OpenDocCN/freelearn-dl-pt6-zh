- en: As we enter the 21st century, it is quickly becoming apparent that AI and machine
    learning technologies will radically change the way we live our lives in the future.
    We now experience AI daily, from conversational assistants to smart recommendations
    in a search engine, and the average user/consumer now expects a smarter interface
    in anything they do. This most certainly includes games, and is likely one of
    the reasons why you, as a game developer, are considering reading this book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will provide you, with a hands-on approach to building deep learning
    models for simple encoding for the purpose of building self-driving algorithms,
    generating music, and creating conversational bots, finishing with an in-depth
    discovery of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We will begin with the basics
    of reinforcement learning (RL) and progress to combining DL and RL in order to
    create DRL. Then, we will take an in-depth look at ways to optimize reinforcement
    learning to train agents in order to perform complex tasks, from navigating hallways
    to playing soccer against zombies. Along the way, we will learn the nuances of
    tuning hyperparameters through hands-on trial and error, as well as how to use
    cutting-edge algorithms, including curiosity learning, Curriculum Learning, backplay,
    and imitation learning, in order to optimize agent training.

- en: This book is for any game–or budding–game developer who is interested in using
    deep learning in an aspect of their next game project. In order to be successful
    in learning this material, you should have knowledge of the Python programming
    language and another C-based language, such as C#, C, C++, or Java. In addition,
    a basic knowledge of calculus, statistics, and probability will aid your digestion
    of the materials and facilitate your learning, but this is not essential.

    Games*, covers the background of deep learning in games before moving on to cover
    the basics by building a basic perceptron. From there, we will learn the concepts
    of network layers and build a simple autoencoder.'

    Recurrent Networks*, explores advanced layers, known as convolution and pooling,
    and how to apply them to building a self-driving deep network. Then, we will look
    at the concept of learning sequences with recurrent layers in deep networks.'

    the concept of a GAN, a generative adversarial network or an architectural pattern
    that pits two competing networks against one another. We will then explore and
    use various GANs to generate a game texture and original music.'

    a few forms of conversational chatbot. We will finish the chapter by allowing
    the chatbot to be chatted with through Unity.'
