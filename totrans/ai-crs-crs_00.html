			<h1 class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p class="normal">Hello, data scientists and AI enthusiasts. For many
 years I've created online courses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
which have been very successful and contributed well to the AI 
community. However, something essential was missing. At one point, so 
many AI courses were made that most of my students asked me for guidance
 on how to take the courses. So instead of providing an order in which 
to take the courses, I decided to create an all-in-one full guide to AI 
as a book, which would include in a perfect structure all the best 
explanations and real-world practical activities from my courses.</p>
			<p class="normal">You see, my goal is to democratize AI and raise 
awareness among everyone of the fact that AI is an accessible technology
 that can make a difference for the better in this world. I am trying my
 best to spread knowledge around the world to get people prepared for 
the future jobs and opportunities of this 21st century. And I thought 
some people would learn AI much more efficiently from an all-in-one book
 they can take anywhere, rather than completing tens of online courses 
that can be hard to navigate. That being said, this book is also a great
 additional resource for those people who do prefer, and take, online 
courses.</p>
			<p class="normal">My simple hope for this book is that more people 
learn AI the right way, as a result of me offering them this efficient 
alternative to online courses. I've succeeded at the challenge of 
including the best of my training in a single book, and today I'm truly 
happy to release it. I sincerely hope it will help more people land 
their dream job, grow an amazing career in data science or AI, and bring
 beautiful solutions to the tough challenges of this 21st century.</p>
