    like the ones on Kaggle, which contain problems that can be solved with deep reinforcement
    learning. You could build some new AIs like the one we created for the self-driving

    domain knowledge, you can combine that with your new AI skills to solve some problems
    in these industries. You can increase your impact by working with or in some tech
    companies, or by building your own one. There will always be massive demand for AI
    in each of these fields, which will always open many doors to you.

- en: Practicing is a necessity, but it's definitely not enough to make an impact
    with AI in this world. You also have to network. Whether it's working for a tech
    company, a company in another industry with an AI team, or for your own business,
    you should always network. This will open new doors, seed new opportunities, and increase
    your chances of success.

    can visit, and the closest one will never be too far from your place. If you can''t
    get to one, you can easily organize some AI meetups and after-work sessions yourself,
    where you discuss AI with other passionate people. You can also create groups
    using social media, where you can exchange ideas, brainstorm AI problems, and
    perhaps establish new connections through which you form synergy. Again, the more
    you network, the more you get all these benefits: connections, generated ideas,
    synergies, opportunities, opened doors, and AI journeys.'

    life. The final recommendation I want to give you is the following.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Never stop learning
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI is a fast-evolving world so you must keep up to date on the latest state-of-the-art
    features. This book doesn't cover the latest breakthroughs in AI, but has given
    you the right basics and intuition for you to approach the latest developments
    in AI with confidence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The right basics are a necessity, but not enough for you to keep up over time.
    What you must do is never stop learning. The good news is that it's easy to keep
    learning today! There are many great MOOCs that cover the latest advanced models
    in AI, as well as articles, research papers, blogs, not to mention YouTube videos
    where you can find the entirety of whole AI theory explained from scratch up to
    the state-of-the-art models. You have plenty of options to feed your brain with
    up-to-date AI knowledge. Just make sure you don't pick the worst reviewed content,
    and you'll be fine.

- en: And, of course, keep up the hard work!
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Yes, hard work will always be essential. Remember this. Success is only the
    tip of the iceberg, under which is hidden a tremendous amount of hard work. But
    don''t worry; as soon as you feel passionate about your work and the purpose you
    follow, work will never be too hard. It will, in fact, feel effortless. That''s
    why my recommendation number 2 here is very important: if you manage to pick a
    domain that resonates with your purpose, then you''ll have found your way to make
    an impact with passion. If your passion is pure AI, even better! Then you can
    leverage it to solve problems and tackle challenges in several fields of applications,
    which gives you the amazing opportunity to have a diversified career.'

    was a great pleasure writing this book for you; my purpose is to democratize AI,
    and raise awareness among everyone that AI is an accessible technology that can
    make a difference for the better in this world. Thank you so much, and enjoy AI!
